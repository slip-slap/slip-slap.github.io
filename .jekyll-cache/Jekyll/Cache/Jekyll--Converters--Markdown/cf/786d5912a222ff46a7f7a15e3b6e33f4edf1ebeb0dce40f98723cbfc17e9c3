<h4 id="2-opt-and-usrlocal">2. /opt and /usr/local</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In the old days, the /opt directory is used for UNIX vendors to hold third-party packages.</li>
  <li>the /usr/local is used for software that is not managed by the system packager, but still following 
the standard unix deploy rules. That’s why you have the following directories in the /usr/local
    <ul>
      <li>/usr/local/include</li>
      <li>/usr/local/bin</li>
      <li>/usr/local/sbin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>/opt is for software doesn’t follow this and is deployed in a monolithic fashion.</li>

  <li>The directory structure of an operating system must have hierarch
property, because some files are important to run the operation system, some
are not, we need to put them in different folders.</li>
  <li>Modern operation system is designed to be accessed by multiple users,
according to the privelege of the users, we have to have the hierarch, for
example, some library is designed for operation system use, some are for
develop application, they are different, so we have to separate them into
different folders.</li>
