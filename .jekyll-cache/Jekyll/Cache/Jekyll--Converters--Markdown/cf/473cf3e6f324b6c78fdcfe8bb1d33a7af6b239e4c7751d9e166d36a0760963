<p>In statistics, a statistic is sufficient with respect to a statistical model and
its assoiated unknown parameter if ‚Äúno other statistic that can be calculated
from the same sample provides any additional information as to the the value of
the parameter.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Factorization theorem</strong>: If the density(or probability function) for a model
factoer as $f_X(x)=h(x)g(\theta, T(x))$, then T is a sufficient statistic.</p>
