<p>Let $ O=\left{o_{1}, o_{2}, \ldots, o_{m}\right} $ be a set of basic outcomes and $ \mathscr{L}(O)
$ be the set of simple lotteries over $O$. If $ \succsim $ is a von Neumann-Morgenstern ranking of
the element of $\mathsrc{L}(O)$ then there exists a function $U: O \rightarrow R$, called a von
Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Utility function that assigns a number(called utility) to
every basic outcome and is such that, for any two lotteries</p>

<p>$ L=\left(\begin{array}{llll}o_{1} &amp; o_{2} &amp; \cdots &amp; o_{m} \ p_{1} &amp; p_{2} &amp; \ldots &amp;
p_{m}\end{array}\right) $ and $ L^{\prime}=\left(\begin{array}{llll}o_{1} &amp; o_{2} &amp; \cdots &amp; o_{m}
\ p_{1} &amp; p_{2} &amp; \ldots &amp; p_{m}\end{array}\right) $</p>

<ul>
  <li>A utility function is a tool that we can use to represent her ranking, nothing more than that.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="normalized-utility-function">Normalized Utility Function</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Let $U:O \rightarrow R$ be a utility function that represents a given von Neumann-Morgenstern
ranking $\succsim$ of the set of lotteries $\mathsrc{L}(O)$, We say that U is normalized if
$U(o_{\text{worst}}) = 0$ and $U(o_{\text{best}}) = 1$</li>

<p>‚ÄúRationality‚Äù does not, and should not, dictate whether an individial should be risk neutral, risk
averse or risk loving;</p>
<ul>
  <li>An individual‚Äôs attitude to risk is merely a reflection of that individual‚Äôs preferences</li>
  <li>According to this principle, there is no such thing as an irrational preference and thus there is
no such thing as an irrational attitude to risk.</li>
  <li>From an empirical point of view, however, most people reveal through their choices that they are
risk averse, at least when the stakes are high.</li>
</ul>
