<h4 id="1-necessary-and-required">1. Necessary and Required</h4>
<p>Required is used in the context of arbitrary rules and regulations, that is,
when there is some requirement by law or convention that must be must be met in
order for something to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Example.</strong> A password is required by law when a person is travelling from one
country to another, and drivers are required to carry their driver’s license
with them when they are driving.</p>

<p>Necessary is used when we want to say that something is needed logically or as
a practical matter and <strong>without it some desired result cannot be obtained.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example.</strong> some form of electricity is necessary for the operation of
electrical devices, and it is necessary for a person to have reached puberty for
him or her to be able to be a biological parent.</p>

<h4 id="2-need-and-entail">2. Need and Entail</h4>
<p>As verbs the difference between need and entail is that need is to be nessary
while entail is to imply or require.</p>

<h4 id="3-stage-period-and-phase">3. Stage, period and phase</h4>
<p>According to the wikipedia, the definition is as the following: 1) Period - A
length or portion of time;  2) Stage - A point, period, or step in a process or
development; 3) Phase - A distinct period or stage in a process of change or
forming part of something’s development.</p>

<p><strong>Difference.</strong> The difference is that <em>stage</em> refers to a particular level that

transition.</p>
