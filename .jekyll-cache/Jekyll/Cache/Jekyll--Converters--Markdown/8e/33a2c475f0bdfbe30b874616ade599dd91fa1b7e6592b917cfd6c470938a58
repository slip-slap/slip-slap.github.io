  <li>Block Code: A block code is a rule for converting a sequence of source bits
s, of length K, say, into a transmitted sequence t of length N bits.
    <ul>
      <li>To add redundancy, we make N greater than K. In a linear block code, the extra
N-K bits are linear functions of the original K bits;</li>
      <li>These extra bits are called parity-check bits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The first four transmitted bits, $t_1t_2t_3t_4$ are set equal to the four
sources bits $s_1s_2s_3s_4$</li>
  <li>The parity-check bits $t_5t_6t_7$ are set so that the parity within each
circle is even</li>
  <li>The figure shows the transmitted codeword for the case s=1000</li>
  <li>These codewords have the special property that any pair differ from each other
in at least three bits.</li>
</ul>

<p>$t=G^t s$
\(\mathbf{G}^{\top}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}{1} &amp; {0} &amp; {0} &amp; {0} \\ {0} &amp; {1} &amp;
{0} &amp; {0} \\ {0} &amp; {0} &amp; {1} &amp; {0} \\ {0} &amp; {0} &amp; {0} &amp; {1} \\ {1} &amp; {1} &amp; {1} &amp;
{0} \\ {0} &amp; {1} &amp; {1} &amp; {1} \\ {1} &amp; {0} &amp; {1} &amp; {1}\end{array}\right]\)</p>

<ol>
  <li>If we assume that the channel is a binary symmetric channel and that all
source vectors are equiprobablle, then the optimal decoder identifies the
source vector s whose encoding $t(s)$ differs from the received vector t in
the fewest bits.</li>
