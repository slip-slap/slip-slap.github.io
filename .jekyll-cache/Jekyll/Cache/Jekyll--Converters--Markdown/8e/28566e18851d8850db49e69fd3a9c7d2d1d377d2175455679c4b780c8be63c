<p>At the heart of the theory of inference is the concept of the statistical
model$f_{\theta}: \theta \in \omega$ that describes the statisticianâ€™s
uncertainty about how the observed data were produced. 
<strong>all
   uncertainties need to be described by probabilities</strong>, then the prescription of
   a model alone is incomplete.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The spread of the posterior distribution gives some idea of the precision on
any probability statements we make about $\theta$</li>
  <li>Note how much information the data have added, as reflected in the graphs of
the prior and posterior densities.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>beyond the model and the data, prior belief is introduced into inference,
thatâ€™s bayesian inference.</li>
  <li>Why we called this posterior inference, because we have a prior inference.</li>
</ol>
