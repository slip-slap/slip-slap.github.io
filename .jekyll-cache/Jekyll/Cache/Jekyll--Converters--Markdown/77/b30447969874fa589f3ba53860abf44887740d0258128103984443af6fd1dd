<ol>
  <li>A game-frame in strategic form is a list of four items(a quadruple) $
\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}\right), O, f\right\rangle
$ where :
    <ul>
      <li>$I = {1,2,\cdots,n}$ is a set of players</li>
      <li>$
\left(S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}\right)
$ is a list of sets, one for each player, for every Player $i \in I$, $S_i$ is
the set of strategies of Player $i$. We denote by S the Cartesian product of
these sets: $
S=S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \cdots \times S_{n}
$; thus an element of S is a list $s = (s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n)$ consisting of one
strategy for each player. We call S the set of strategy profiles.</li>
      <li>$O$ is a set of outcomes</li>
      <li>$
f: S \rightarrow O
$ is a function that associates with every strategy profile s an outcome $f(s)
\in O$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An ordinal game in strategic form is a quintuple $
\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, \ldots, S_{n}\right), O, f,\left(\succsim_{1},
\ldots, \succsim_{n}\right)\right\rangle
$
    <ul>
      <li>$
\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}\right), O, f\right\rangle
$ is a game-frame in strategic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reduced-form ordinal game in strategic form(called reduced form because some information is lost,
namely the specification of the outcomes): $
\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, \ldots, S_{n}\right),\left(\pi_{1}, \ldots,
\pi_{n}\right)\right\rangle
$</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>$
o \succsim_{i} o^{\prime}
$, Player $i$ considers outcome $o$ to be at least as good as $o^{\prime}$</li>
  <li>$
o \succ_{i} o^{\prime}
$, Player i considers outcome $o$ to be better then $o^{\prime}$</li>
  <li>$
o \sim_{i} o^{\prime}
$, Player i considers outcome $o$ to be just as good as $o^{\prime}$</li>

  <li>Ordinal utility function: Given a complete and transitive ranking $
\succsim
$ of a finite set of outcomes O, a function $
U: O \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$ (where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the set of real numbers) is said to be an ordinal
utility function that represents the ranking $\succsim$, for every two
outcomes $o$ and $o^{\prime}$, $
U(o)&gt;U\left(o^{\prime}\right)
$ if and only if $
o \succ o^{\prime}
$ and $
U(o)=U\left(o^{\prime}\right)
$ 
and only if $
o \sim o^{\prime}
$
    <ul>
      <li>Utility means number</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="terminology">Terminology</h4>
<ol>
  <li>strict dominance: $a$ strictly dominates $b$(or $b$ strictly dominated by $a$) if, in
every situation(that is, no matter what the other players do), $a$ gives
Player $i$ a payoff which is greater than the payoff that $b$ gives.
Formally: for every $
s_{-i} \in S_{-i}, \pi_{i}\left(a, s_{-i}\right)&gt;\pi_{i}\left(b,
s_{-i}\right)
$</li>
  <li>weak dominance:</li>
  <li>Cardinal Number is a number says how many of something there are.</li>
  <li>Ordinal number is a number tells the position of something in a list.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="pareto-superior">Pareto Superior</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Given an ordinal game in strategic form, let $o$ and $o^{\prime}$ be two outcomes. We say that $o$
is strictly Pareto superior to $o^{\prime}$ if every player prefers $o$ to $o^{\prime}$.</li>
  <li>We say that $o$ is weakly Pareto superior to $o^{\prime}$ if every player considers $o$ to be at
least as good as $o^{\prime}$ and as least one player prefers $o$ to $o^{\prime}$.</li>
  <li>In reduced-form games, this definition can be extended to strategy profiles as follows. If s and
$s^{\prime}$ are two strategy profiles, then $s$ is strictly Pareto superior to $s^{\prime}$ if
$\pi_i(s) &gt; \pi_i(s^{\prime})$ for every player i and s is weakly Pareto superior if $\pi_i(s) &gt; \pi_i(s^{\prime})$
for every Player i and, furthermore, there is a Player j such that $\pi_j(s) &gt; \pi_j(s^{\prime})$</li>
</ol>
