<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Recursive-descent parsing is a top-down method of syntax analysis in which a set of recursive
procedures is used to process the input.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One procedure is associated with each nonterminal of a grammar</li>
  <li>predictive parsing is a simple form of recursive-descent parsing, called predictive parsing, in
which the lookahead symbol unambiguously determine the flow of control through the procedure body
for each nonterminal.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="property">Property</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Predictive parsing relies on information about the first symbols that can be generated by a
production body.
    <ul>
      <li>More precisely, let $\alpha$ be a string of grammar symbols(terminals and/or nonterminals).</li>
      <li>We define FIRST($\alpha$) to be the set of terminals that appear as the first symbols of one or
more strings of terminals generated from $\alpha$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>$\epsilon$-productions
    <ul>
      <li>the predictive parser uses an $epsilon$-production as a default when no other production can be
used</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
