<ol>
  <li>What‚Äôs reason behind the name ‚Äúquotient group‚Äù? It must mean something.</li>
  <li>The reason is equivalence class, after this operation, we get equivalence class.</li>
  <li>How many equivalence class are there? That‚Äôs the quotient.</li>
  <li>This is why the name make sense.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>If H is a subgroup of a group G, then right cosets are not always the same as
left cosets; that is, it is not always the case that $gH=Hg$ for all $g \in G$.
The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group
theory. They allow for the construction of a new class of groups.</p>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A subgroup H of a group G is normal in G if $gH = Hg$ for all $g\in G$. That is,
a normal subgroup of group G is one in which the right and left cosets are
precisely the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Factor Groups: If N is a normal subgroup of a group G, then the cosets of N
in G from a group $G/N$ under the operation $(aN)(bN)=abN$. This group is
called the $\textbf{factor}$ or $\textbf{quotient group}$ of G and N.</p>
