<h4 id="hyphen">Hyphen</h4>
<p>A compound modifier is make up of two words that work together to function like
one adjective. When you connect words with the hyphen, you make it clear to
readers that the words work together as a unit of meaning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incorrect: It‚Äôs recommended you don‚Äôt take down any load bearing walls when renovating.</li>
  <li>Correct: It‚Äôs recommended you don‚Äôt take down any load-bearing walls when renovating.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you need the hyphen only if the two words are functioning together
as an adjective before the noun that‚Äôre describing. If the noun comes first,
leave the hyphen out.</p>

  <li>This wall is load bearing.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs impossible to eat this cake because it is rock hard.</li>
  <li>It this hotel dog friendly.</li>
