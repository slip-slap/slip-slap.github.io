<h4 id="metric-space">Metric Space</h4>
<p>Metric Space: a metric space is a set together with a metric on the set, The metric is a function that defines a concept of distance between
any two members of the set. <br />
A metric space is an ordered pair(M,d), where M is a set and d is a metric on M. <br /></p>

\[d : M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\]

<ol>
  <li>The distance from a point to itself is zero</li>
  <li>the distance between two distinct point is positive</li>
  <li>the ditance from A to B is the same as the distance from B to A</li>
  <li>the distance from A to B directly is less than or equal to the distance from A to B via any third point C.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="complete-metric-space">complete metric space</h4>
<p>complete metric space: A complete metric space is a metric space in which every Cauchy sequence is convergent. <br />
cauchy sequence: is a sequence whose elements become arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses. More precisely, given any small
positive distance, all but a finite number of elements of the sequence are less than that given distance from each other. <br /></p>

<p>According to the definition,</p>
<ol>
  <li>the structure of the sequence decides whether sequence is a Cauchy sequence.</li>
  <li>the factor decide whether the sequence is convergent depends on the property of the space.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="separable-metric-space">separable metric space</h4>
<p>A topological space is called separable if it contains a countable, dense subset. <br />
Example: real number set is separable metric space.</p>
<ol>
  <li>It contains rational number set, rational is dense in R.</li>
  <li>Q is countable.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>The Rational Number Space Q is  incomplete, There is cauchy sequence, and itâ€™s limit is not Q <br />
1 1.4 1.41 1.414 1.4141 â€¦. <br />
But Real Number is a complete metric space.<br />
Q can be embeded in R, and R is complete.</p>
