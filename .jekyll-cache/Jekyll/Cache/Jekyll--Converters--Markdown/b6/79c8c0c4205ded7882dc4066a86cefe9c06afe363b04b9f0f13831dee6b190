<ol>
  <li>In mathematics, a quadratic form is a polynomial with terms all of degree
two, for example,
\(4x^2 + 2xy - 3y^2\)
is a quadratic form in the variables x and y. The coefficients usually belongs
to a fixed field K.</li>
  <li>homogeneous polynomials, a homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial whose
nonzero terms all have the same degree.
\(x^5+2x^3y^2+9xy\)
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.</li>
  <li>A quadratic form is one case of the more general concept of homogeneous
polynomials.</li>
