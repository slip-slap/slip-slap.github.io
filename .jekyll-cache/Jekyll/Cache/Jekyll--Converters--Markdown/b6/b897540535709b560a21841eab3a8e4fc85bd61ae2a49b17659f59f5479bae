<ol>
  <li>CMake input files are written in the â€œCMake Languageâ€ in source files named
<strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong> or ending in a <strong>.cmake</strong> file name extension. CMake
Language source files in a project are organized into:
    <ul>
      <li>Directories</li>
      <li>Scripts</li>
      <li>Modules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="cmake">CMake</h4>
<ol>
  <li>You must treat Cmake as a programming language with <strong>special syntax</strong>, how
to treat cmake as a programming language, things you need keep in mind
    <ul>
      <li>treat every statement with parenthesis as a function, figure out the function
mean and related parameters</li>
      <li>itâ€™s a special language, because it has predefined variable, you need pay
attention.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compared with maven, all the required library is in local, it doesnâ€™t have
default catagory structure.</li>
  <li>Both of them need configuration file, maven need â€œpom.xmlâ€, cmake needs
â€œCMakeLists.txtâ€</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="with-make">With Make</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Make is designed to debug c language, but itâ€™s not easy to use.</li>
  <li>So cmake comes out, the code you write in CMakeLists.txt would be translated
to Makefile.</li>
  <li>for example <strong>add_executable(Tutorial tutorial.cxx)</strong> in CMakeLists,
actually will be translated into corresponding make language, such as
compile, link etc.</li>
</ol>
