<h4 id="command-type">Command Type</h4>
<p>In linux, nothing is secret, you can get any where and know everything. A
command can be one of the four different things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An executable program, such as files we saw in /usr/bin. Within this
category, programs can be compiled binaries such as programs written in C and
C++, or programs written in scripting languages such as the shell, python,
ruby.</li>
  <li>A command build into the shell itself. Bash supports a number of commands
internally called shell builtins. the <strong>cd</strong> command.</li>
  <li>A shell function. These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the
envrionment.</li>
  <li>An alias. Commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="h">H</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>type: is a shell builtion that displays the kind of comman the shell will
execute.</p>
  </li>
  <li>which: display an executeableâ€™s location
    <ul>
      <li>which only works for executable programs, not builtions nor aliases that are
substitutes for actual executable programs.</li>
      <li>When we try to use which on a shell builtion, for example, cd, we either get
no response or an error message.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>help</li>
  <li>man</li>
  <li>apropos</li>
  <li>info</li>
  <li>whatis</li>
  <li>alias</li>
</ol>
