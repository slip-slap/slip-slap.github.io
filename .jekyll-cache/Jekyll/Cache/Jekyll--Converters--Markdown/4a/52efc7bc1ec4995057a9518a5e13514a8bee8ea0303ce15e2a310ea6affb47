<h4 id="graph-loop-link">Graph, Loop, Link</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A graph G is an ordered triple $(V(G),E(G),\psi_G)$ consisting of a nonempty set
V(G) of vertices, a set E(G), disjoint from V(G), of edges, and an <strong>incidence
function</strong> $\psi_G$ that associates with each edge of G an unordered pair of(not
necessarily distinct) vertices of G. If $e$ is an edge and $u$ and $v$ are
vertices such that $\psi_G(e)=uv$, then $e$ is said to join $u$ and $v$;</li>
  <li>Loop: An edge with identical ends is called a loop.</li>
  <li>Link: An edge with distinct ends is called a link.</li>
  <li>Incident: The ends of an edge are said to be incident with the edge
    <ul>
      <li>incidence: the angle at which a ray (such as a ray of light) hits a surface,
that is the nature meaning of <strong>the world incidence</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adjacent: Two vertices which are incident with a common edge are adjacent, as
are two edges which are incident with a common vertex.
    <ul>
      <li>When the word adjacent pops up, most times, it means relationgship between two
vertices.</li>
      <li>There is no unique way of drawing a graph; A diagram of a graph merely
depicts the incidence relation holding between its vertices and edges.</li>
      <li>We often draw a diagram of a graph and refer to it as the graph itself; in
the same spirit, we shall call its points â€˜verticesâ€™ and its lines â€˜edgesâ€™.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="special-graphs">Special Graphs</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Simple Graph: A graph is simple if it has no loops and no two of its links
join the same pair of vertices.</li>
  <li>Complete Graph: A simple graph in which each pair of distinct vertices is
joined by an edge is called a complete graph.
    <ul>
      <li>There is just one complete graph on n vertices; it is denoted by $K_n$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/math-discrete-graph-theory-graph-and-subgraph.png" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Empty Graph: a graph with no edges.</li>
  <li>Bipartite graph: a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into two subsets
X and Y, so that each edge has one end in X and one end in Y;</li>
  <li>Complete Biparite Graph: a simple bipartite graph with bipartition (X,Y) in
which each vertex of X is joined to each vertex of Y; if |X|=m and |Y|=n,
such a graph is denoted by $K_{m,n}$</li>
  <li>Trivial and Nontrivial: We call a graph with just one vertex trivial and all
other graphs nontrivial</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notation">Notation</h4>
<ol>
  <li>$v(G)$ denotes the number of vertices.</li>
  <li>$\epsilon(G)$ denotes the number of edges.</li>
  <li>When just one graph under discussion, we usually denote this graph by G, We
omit the letter G from graph-theoretic symbols and write, for instance,
$V,E,v,\epsilon$ instead of V(G), E(G),v(G) and $\epsilon(G)$</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="graph-isomporphism">Graph Isomporphism</h4>
<p>In general, two graphs G and H are said to be isomorphic</p>

<h4 id="incidence-and-adjacency-matrices">Incidence and Adjacency Matrices</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Incidence Matrix:  To any graph G there corresponds a $v\times \epsilon$ matrix called the
incidence matrix</li>
  <li>Vertices of G: denote by $v_1, v_2,\cdots,v_v$</li>
  <li>Edges of G: denote by $e_1,e_2,\cdots,e_{\epsilon}$</li>
  <li>Incidence Matrix of G: denotes by $M(G)=[m_{ij}]$</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="subgraphs">Subgraphs</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Subgraph: A graph H is a subgraph of G(written $H\subseteq G$) if $V(H)
\subseteq V(G)$, $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$, and $\psi_H$ is the restriction of
$\psi_G$ to $E(H)$</li>
  <li>Proper Subgraph: When $H \subseteq G$ but \(H \neq G\), we wirte $H \subset G$, and call H a proper subgraph of G.</li>
  <li>Underlying Simple Graph: By deleting from G all loops and, for every pair of
adjacent vertices, all but one link joining them, we obtain a simple spanning
subgraph of G, called the underlying simple graph of G.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Connected: two vertices $u$ and $v$ v are said to be connected if there is a
$(u,v)$-path in G.</li>
  <li>Connection is an equivalence relation on the vertex set V. Thus there is a
partition of V into nonempty subsets $V_1,V_2,\cdots,V_w$ such that two
vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected if and only if $u$ and $v$ belong to the
same set $V_i$</li>
  <li>Component: the subgraphs $G[V_1],G[V_2],\cdots,G[V_w]$ are called the
components of G. If G has exactly one component, G is connected, otherwise G
is disconnected.
    <ol>
      <li>A Spanning Subgraph: If H is a subgraph of G, G is a supergraph of H, a
 spanning subgraph(or spanning supergraph) of G is a subgraph (or supergraph)
 H with $V(H)=V(G)$</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="induced-graph">Induced Graph</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Induced Subgraph: Suppose that $V^{\prime}$ is a nonempty subset of V. The
subgraph of G whose vertex set is $V^{\prime}$ and whose edge set is the set
of those edges of G that have both ends in $V^{\prime}$ is called the
subgraph of G induced by $V^{\prime}$ and is denoted by $G[V^{\prime}]$
    <ul>
      <li>The induced subgraph $G[V\V^{\prime}]$ is denoted by $G-V^{\prime}$</li>
      <li>it is the subgraph obtained from G by deleting the vertices in $V^{\prime}$
together with their incident edges.</li>
      <li>If $V^{\prime}={v}$ we write $G-v$ for $G-{ v }$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Edge-induced Subgraph: suppose that $E^{\prime}$ is a nonempty subset of E.
The subgraph of G whose vertex set is the set of ends of edges in $E^{\prime}$ and
whose edge set is $E^{\prime}$ is called the subgraph of G induced by
$E^{\prime}$ and denoted by $G[E^{\prime}]$</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="vertex-degrees">Vertex Degrees</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The degree $d_G(v)$ of a vertex $v$ in G is the number of edges of G incident
with $v$, each loop counting as two edges. We denote by $\delta(G)$ and
$\Delta (G)$ the minimum and maximum degrees, respectively, of vertices of G. 
<br />
\(\sum_{v \in V} d(v)=2 \varepsilon\)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="paths-and-connection">Paths and Connection</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Walk: A walk in G is a finite non-null sequence $W=v_0e_1v_1e_2v_2\cdots
e_kv_k$, whose terms are alternatively vertices and edges. <br />
for $1\leq i \leq k$, the ends of $e_i$ are $v_{i-1}$ and $v_i$. We say that
W is a walk from $v_0$ to $v_k$, or $v_0,v_k$-walk</li>
  <li>Origin and Terminus: the vertices $v_0$ and $v_k$ are called the origin and
terminus of W</li>
  <li>Internal Vertices: $v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_{k-1}$ its internal vertices</li>
  <li>Length: the integer k is the length of W.</li>
  <li>Trail: If the edges $e_1, e_2,\cdots,e_k$ of a walk W are distinct, W is
called a trail.</li>
  <li>Path: if the vertices $v_0,v_1,\cdots,v_k$ of a walk W are distinct, W is
called a path.</li>
  <li>Connection: Two vertices u and v of G are said to be connected if there is a
$(u,v)$-pathin G.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="cycles">Cycles</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Closed Walk: a walk is closed if it has positive length and its origin and
terminus are the same</li>
  <li>Cycle: A closed trail whose origin and internal vertices are distinct is a
cycle.</li>
  <li>K-cycle: A cycle of length k is called a k-cycle, a k-cycle is odd or even
according as k is odd or even.</li>
  <li>Triangle: A 3-cycle is often called a triangle.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="bond-and-edge-cut">Bond and Edge Cut</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Edge Cut: For subsets S and $S^{\prime}$ of V, we denote by $[S,S^{\prime}]$
the set of edges with one end in S and the other is $S^{\prime}$.
    <ul>
      <li>An edge cut of G is a subset of E of the form $[S,\bar{S}]$</li>
      <li>Where S is a nonempty proper subset of V and $\bar{S}=V\S$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bond: A minimal nonempty edge cut of G is called a bond.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="application-shortest-path-problem">Application: Shortest Path Problem</h4>
<p>Problem: Find the shortest $(u_0,v_0)$-path<br />
Solution: Dijkstra Algorithm <br /></p>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
