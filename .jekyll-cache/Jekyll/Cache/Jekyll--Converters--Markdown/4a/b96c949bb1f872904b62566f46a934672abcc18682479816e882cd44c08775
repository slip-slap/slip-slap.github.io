<h4 id="tf-idf">TF-IDF</h4>

<ul>
  <li>TF: Term Frequency, which measures how frequently a term accurs in a document. since every document is different in length.
It is possible that a word would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often
divided by the document length as a way of normalization</li>
</ul>

<p>TF(t) = Number of times term t appears in a document /  total number of terms in the document</p>

<ul>
  <li>IDF: Inverse Document Frequency, which measures how important a word is. while computing TF, all terms are considered equally 
important. However it is known that certain terms, such as ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúof‚Äù, and ‚Äúthat‚Äù, may appear a lot of times but have little imp
ortance. Thus we need to weight down the frequent terms while scale up the rare ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>IDF(t) = Total number of Documents / Number of documents with term t in it.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<p>Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. Assume we have one 10,000 documents, 
and the word cat appears in one thousand of these.</p>

<p>The TF(cat) is 3/100 = 0.3</p>

<p>The IDF(cat) is 10,000/10=1000</p>
