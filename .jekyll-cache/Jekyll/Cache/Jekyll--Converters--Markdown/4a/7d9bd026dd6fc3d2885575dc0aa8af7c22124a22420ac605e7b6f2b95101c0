<p>Iterators are objects that can iterate over elements of a sequence via a common
interface that is adapted from ordinary pointers.</p>

<h4 id="iterator-adapters">Iterator Adapters</h4>
<p>Iterators are pure abstractions: anything that behaves like an iterator is an
iterator. For this reason, you can write classes that have the interface of
iterators but do something completely different.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Insert iterators: they are used to let algorithm operate in insert mode
rather than in overwrite mode. In particular, inserters solve the problem of
algorithms that write to a destiation that does not have enough romm: they
let the destination grow accordingly.</li>
</ol>
