<h4 id="dense-set">Dense set</h4>
<p>Dense set: a subset A of a topological space X is called dense in(X) if every point x in X either belongs to A or is a limit point of A. <br />
the closure of A is constiuting the whole set X.</p>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<p>The rational numbers are a dense subset of real numbers.</p>

<h4 id="nowhere-dense-set">Nowhere dense set</h4>
<p>In mathematics, a nowhere dense set on a topological space is a set whose closure has empty interior.</p>

<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Z is nowhere dense in R</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="countable">countable</h4>
<p>In mathematical terms, a set is countable either if itâ€™s finite, or it is infinite and you can find a one-to-one correspondence between the elements
of the set and the set of natural numbers.</p>

<h4 id="definition">definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Interior point: If S is a subset of a Euclidean space, then x is an interior point of S if there exists an open ball centered at x which
is completely contained in S.</li>
  <li>Adherent point(contact point, closure point): A point x is an adherent point for A if and only if x is in the closure of A.</li>
  <li>Limit point(cluster point,accumulation point): A limit point of a set S in a topological space X is a point that can be approximated by points
of S in the sense that every neighbourhood of x with respect to the topology on X also contains a point of S other than x itself. A limit point of a set
S does not itself have to be an element of S.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="set-closure">set closure</h4>
<p>The clousre of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A. CLosed sets are closed under arbitrary intersection, so it is the also the intersection of
all closed sets containing A.</p>
<ol>
  <li>the closure of a set A, it is just A with all of its accumulation points.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="how-to-compare-the-number-of-two-sets-">How to compare the number of two sets ?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Method 1: get the number of the first set A, and the second set B. According to the sign of A minus B to depend which one is bigger.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Method 2: Imaging a scenirao, in an ancient community, and they donâ€™t know math. There are two hunters both of whom obtained several
animals, how to campare who is outnumber who. 
We can solve this problem in the following way, A throws an animal, and at the same time B throws an animal, too. The guy who is the first one
run out of animal, who loses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>So we can use Method 2 to compare two infinite set. According to the rule of one to one, we can know which one has more numbers.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="russells-barbers-paradox">Russellâ€™s Barbers Paradox</h4>
<p>Consider a group of barbers who shave only those men who do not shave themselves. Suppose
there is a barber in this collection who does not shave himself; then by the definition of 
the collection, he must shave himself. But no barber in the collection can shave himself.</p>
