  <li>Acyclic graph: An acyclic graph is one that contains no cycles.</li>
  <li>Tree: a tree is a connected acyclic graph
    <ul>
      <li>If G is a tree, then $\epsilon= v-1$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cut Edge: A cut edge of G is an edge e such that $w(G-e)&gt;w(G)$.
    <ul>
      <li>The term “Cut Edge” is very intuitive and informative, imaging cut a graph
with with a knife, after the edge is deleted, you have two subgraph, and the
edge is called cut edge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="edges-and-bonds">Edges and Bonds</h5>
<ol>
  <li>For subsets S and $S^{\prime}$ of V, we denote by $[S,S^{\prime}]$ the set of
edges with one end in S and the other in $S^{\prime}$</li>
  <li>Edge Cut: An edge cut of G is a subset of E of the form $[S,\bar{S}]$
    <ul>
      <li>where S is a nonempty proper subset of V</li>
      <li>$\bar{S}=V\S$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bond: A minimal nonempty edge cut of G is called a bond
    <ul>
      <li>each cut edge $e$, for instance, gives rise to a bond ${ e }$</li>
      <li>If G is connected, then a bond B of G is a minimal subset of E such that $G-B$
is disconnected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cotree: If G is connected, a subgraph of the form $\bar{T}$, where T is a
spanning tree, is called a cotree of G.
    <ul>
      <li>If H is a subgraph of G, the complement of H in G, denoted by $\bar{H} (G)$,
is the subgraph $G-E(H)$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="theorem">Theorem</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In a tree, any two vertices are connected by a unique path.</li>
  <li>A connected graph is a tree if and only if every edge is a cut edge.
    <ul>
      <li>Every connected graph contains a spanning tree.</li>
      <li>If G is connected, then $\epsilon \geq v-1$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let T be a spanning tree of a connected graph G and let $e$ be an edge of G
not in T. Then $T+e$ contains a unique cycle.</li>

  <li>Contracted: An edge e of G is said to be contracted if it is deleted and its
ends are identified
    <ul>
      <li>the resulting graph is denoted by $G\cdot e$</li>
      <li>The number of spanning trees of G by $\tau(G)$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="theorem-1">Theorem</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If $e$ is a link of G, then $\tau(G)=\tau (G-e)+\tau (G \cdot e)$</li>
