<h4 id="poisson-combining">Poisson Combining</h4>
<p>The sum of many small independent arrival processes tends to be close to Poisson
even if the small processes are not.  In a sense, the independence between the
processes overcomes the dependence between successive arrivals in each process.</p>

<h4 id="splitting-a-poisson-process">Splitting a Poisson process</h4>
<p>Each arrival is switched to \({N_1(t);t&gt;0}\) with probabiity \(p\) and otherwise
goes to \({N_2(t);t&gt;0}\).  View the switch as a Bernoulli process independent of
\({N(t);t&gt;0}\). A \(p\) biased coin is flipped independently at each arrival</p>
