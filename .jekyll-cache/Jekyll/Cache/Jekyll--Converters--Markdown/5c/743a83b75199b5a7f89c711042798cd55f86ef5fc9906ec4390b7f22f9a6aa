configuration scripts called startup files, which define the default
environemnt shared by all users.</li>
  <li>This is followed by more startup files in our home directory that define our
personal environment. The exact sequence depends on the type of shell session
being started.</li>
  <li>There are tow kinds: a login shell session and a non-log-in shell session.</li>
