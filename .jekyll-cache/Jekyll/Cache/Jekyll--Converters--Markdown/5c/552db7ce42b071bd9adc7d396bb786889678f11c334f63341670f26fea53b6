  <li>Edge: A directed link, such as $X \rightarrow Y$, represents an edge, and we
will call it an edge.</li>
  <li>Given the edge $X \rightarrow Y$, we say the tail of the edge is at $X$ and
the head of the edge is $Y$.
We also say the following:
    <ul>
      <li>A chain $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ is a <strong>head-to-tail meeting</strong>, the
edges meet <strong>head-to-tail</strong> at $Z$, and $Z$ is a <strong>head-to-tail</strong> node on the
chain.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
