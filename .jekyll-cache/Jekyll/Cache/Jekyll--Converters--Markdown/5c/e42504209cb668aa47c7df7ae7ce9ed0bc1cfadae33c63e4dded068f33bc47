<h4 id="sampling">Sampling</h4>
<p>Sampling is important in simulation, and the methods vary a lot according to the
target distribution. The cases are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The most basic case is a the probability distribution with one random
variable, for both continueous variable and discrete variable. There are two
solutions:
    <ul>
      <li>Inversion method for generating random variables.</li>
      <li>Construct a sophisticated random variable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In some cases, the probability distribution is not fully understand, and only
part of it is accessible. Researchers develop the following trick for
different cases.
    <ul>
      <li>Only the ratio of the probability of any two values of a random variable is
known: MCMC</li>
      <li>Multiple random variables get involved: Gibbs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
