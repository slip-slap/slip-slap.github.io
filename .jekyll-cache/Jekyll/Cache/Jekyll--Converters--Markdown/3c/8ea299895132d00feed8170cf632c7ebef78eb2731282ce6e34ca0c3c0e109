  <li>Cardinality: in classical set theory this is the number of elements in a set. This is written as $M(A)$. For a finite fuzzy set we can write:</li>
</ol>

<p>$M(A)= \sum_{x\in X}{m_A(x)}$</p>
<ul>
  <li>The intuition behind this formula is that the contribution of an element to
the cardinality should be weighted with the membership function.</li>
  <li>An element that hardly belongs to the set (very small value of the membership
function) contributes little to the cardinality of the set.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Intersection: given two fuzzy sets A and B, the membership function of the intersection is defined as
$m_c(x)= min{m_A{x},m_B(x)},x \in X$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Union: given two fuzzy sets A and B, the membership function of the union is defined as
$m_c(x)= max{m_A{x},m_B(x)},x \in X$</p>
  </li>
</ol>
