<p>Independence is a concept in proability theory, can we identify this in a graph?
The scheme is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define new concept in graph</li>
  <li>Relate them to independence</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-new-concept-in-graph">2. New concept in graph</h4>
<p>Let \(\mathbb{G}=(\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{E})\) be a DAG, \(A \subseteq V\), $X$
and $Y$ be distinct nodes in $V-A$, and $\rho$ be a chain between $X$ and $Y$.
Then $\rho$ is blocked by A is one of the following holds:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There is a node $Z\in A$ on the chain $\rho$, and the edges incident to $Z$ on
$\rho$ meet head-to-tail at $Z$.</li>
  <li>There is a node $Z \in A$ on the chain $\rho$, and the edges incident to $Z$
on $\rho$ meet tail-to-tail at Z.</li>
</ol>
