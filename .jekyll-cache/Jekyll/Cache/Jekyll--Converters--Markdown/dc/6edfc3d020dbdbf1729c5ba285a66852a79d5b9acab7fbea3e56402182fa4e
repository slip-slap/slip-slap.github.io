<p>The <strong>Bertrand paradox</strong> is a problem within the classical interpretation of
probability theory, as an example to show that the principle of indifference may
not be produce definite, well-defined, results for probabilities if it is
applied uncritically when the domain of possibilities is infinite.</p>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>The problem is presented as follows: consider an equilateral triangle inscribed
in a circle. Suppose a chord of the circle is chosen as random. What is the
probability that the chord is longer than a side of the triangle?</p>
