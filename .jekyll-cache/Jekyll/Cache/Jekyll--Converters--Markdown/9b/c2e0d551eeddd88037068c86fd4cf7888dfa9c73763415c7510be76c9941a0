  <li>A parser is a function that determines whether a pattern belongs to a language</li>
  <li>LL(1):
    <ul>
      <li>The first “L” in LL(1) stands for scanning the input from lett to right.</li>
      <li>The second “L” for producing a leftmost derivation</li>
      <li>The “1” for using one input symbol of lookahead at each step to make parsing action decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>LL(1) parser only work for a large subset of the CFGs known as LL(1) grammar, although the set of
context free languages recongnizable by an LL(1) grammar is a subset of the context free
languages, it is a very large subset and you shoudn’t run into too many difficulties using this
technique.</li>
