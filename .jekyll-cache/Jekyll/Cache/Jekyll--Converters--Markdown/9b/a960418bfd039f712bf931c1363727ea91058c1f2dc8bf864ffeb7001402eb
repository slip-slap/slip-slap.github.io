  <li>
    <p>A set of weight matrices that come into that layer(which may connect from
other layers or from external inputs)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Any tapped delay lines(represented by $Dl_{m,l}$ or $DI_{m,l}$) that appear
at the input of a set of weight matrices(Any set of weight matrices can be
preceded by a TDL. For example, Layer 1 in the figure contains the weight 
$\textbf{LW}^{1,3}$ and the corresponding TDL)</li>
  <li>A bias vector</li>
  <li>A summing junction</li>
  <li>A transfer function</li>
