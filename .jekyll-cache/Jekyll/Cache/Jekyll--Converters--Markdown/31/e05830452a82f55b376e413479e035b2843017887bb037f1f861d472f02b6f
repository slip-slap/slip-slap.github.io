<p><strong>Irreducible:</strong> A Markov chain is <em>irreducible</em> if it is possible for the chain
to move from any state to any other state. Equivalently, the Markov chian is
irreducible if for any $i,j \in S$, there is a positive integer $n$ with
$P_i(X_n = j) &gt; 0$.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Markov chain is irreducible if its associated transition matrix has 0 entry.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aperiodic:</strong> A Markov chian is aperiodic if the period of each state is equal
to 1.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If a Markov chian has $p_{ij} &gt; 0$ for all $i,j \in S$, then the
chain is irreducible and aperiodic</p>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Suppose a Markov chain is irreducilbe and aperiodic and has a
stationary distributon ${\pi_i}$. Then regardless of the initial distribution
${\mu_i}$, we have $ \lim <em>{n \rightarrow \infty}
P\left(X</em>{n}=i\right)=\pi_{i} $ for all states $i$.</p>
