<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Hyperbolic Point</strong>: A hyperbolic point is a proportion $a \equiv [x:y:z]$ of rational numbers in
square brackets.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperbolic Line</strong>: A hyperbolic line line is a proportion $L \equiv (l:m:n)$
of rational numbers in round brackets.</li>
  <li><strong>Points Lies on Line</strong>: A point $a \equiv [x:y:z]$ lies on the line $L \equiv (l:m:n)$,
 \(\Leftrightarrow\) $lx+my-nz=0$</li>
  <li>Special points and line on the geometry. <br />
Point p= [1:2:0] <br />
Line  l=(0:0:3)  which stands for 0x+0y=3, which meaningless, however, we can
deal with this in three dimensional space, which is 0x+0y-3z=0, which is
horizontal plane, which is the line at infinity.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="formula">Formula</h4>
<p>\(J\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\right) \equiv\left(y_{1}
z_{2}-y_{2} z_{1}: z_{1} x_{2}-z_{2} x_{1}: x_{2} y_{1}-x_{1} y_{2}\right)\)
<br />
\(j\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\right) \equiv\left(y_{1}
z_{2}-y_{2} z_{1}: z_{1} x_{2}-z_{2} x_{1}: x_{2} y_{1}-x_{1} y_{2}\right)\)</p>

<p>where round bracket denote line with captial letter, squre brackets denote point
with small letter.</p>

  <li>In this section, we introduce homogeneous coordinate, just as in Euclidean
geometry, the Cartesian coordinate is introduced.</li>
