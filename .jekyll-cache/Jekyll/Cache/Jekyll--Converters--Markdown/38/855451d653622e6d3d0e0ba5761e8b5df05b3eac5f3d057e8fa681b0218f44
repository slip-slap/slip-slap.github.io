<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<ol>
  <li>group composition is just set permutation.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Transpostions: the simplest permutation is a cycle of length 2, such cycles
are called transpositions.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="theorem">Theorem</h4>
<p>If a permutation $\sigma$ can be expressed as the product of an even number of
transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling $\sigma$ must
also contain an even number of transpositions, then any other product of
transpotitions equaling $\sigma$ must also contain an odd number of
transpositions.</p>
