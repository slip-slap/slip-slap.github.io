<ol>
  <li>Lattice: An order $(L;\leq)$ is a lattice if $sup{a,b}$ and $inf{a,b}$
exist for all $a,b \in L$
    <ul>
      <li>In other words, lattice theory singles out a special type of order for
detailed investigation</li>
      <li>To make such a definition worthwhile, it must be shown that this class or
orders is a very useful class, that there are many such orders in various
branches of mathematics(analysis, topology, logic, algebra, geometry, and so
on)</li>
    </ul>
