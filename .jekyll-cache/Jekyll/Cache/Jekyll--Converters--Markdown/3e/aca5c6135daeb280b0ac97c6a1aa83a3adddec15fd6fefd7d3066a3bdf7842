<p>The ancient greek playright once said: ‚Äúevery man is like the company he is wont
to keep‚Äù</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we want to single out a particular object in a category, we can only do
this by describing its pattern of relationships with other objects(and
itself).</li>
  <li>These relationships are defined by morphisms.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>There is a common construction in category theory called the universal
construction for defining objects in terms of their relationships</p>
<ul>
  <li>One way of doing this is to pick a pattern, a particular shape constructed
from objects and morphisms, and look ofr all its occurrences in the category.</li>
  <li>If it‚Äôs a common enough pattern, and the category is large, chances are you‚Äôll
have lots and lots of hits.</li>
  <li>The trick is to establish some kind of ranking among those hits, and pick what
could be considered the best fit.</li>
</ul>
