  <li>defective random variable: it means there is some probability that J is going
to be infinite</li>
  <li>Indicator random variable: An indicator random variable is a special kind of
random variable associated with the occurence of an event. The indicator
random variable $I_A$ associate with event A has value 1 if event A occurs
and has value 0 otherwise. In other words, $I_A$ maps all outcomes in the set
A to 1 and all outcomes outside A to 0.

  <li>A stopping trial(or stopping time) J for a sequence of rvâ€™s
$X_1,X_2,\cdots,$ is a positive integer-valued rv such that for each $n\geq 1$,
the indicator rv \(\mathbb{I}_{\{J=n\}}\) is a function of $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$.
    <ul>
      <li>stopping trail doesnâ€™t need IID random variables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generalized Stopping Trial: for a sequence of pairs of rvâ€™s $(X_1,V_1),(X_2,V_2) \cdots$
is a positive integer-valued rv such that, for each $n\geq 1$, the indicator
rv $\mathcal{I}_{{J=n}}$ is a function of $X_1,V_1,X_2,V_2,\cdots,X_n,V_n$
where each pair</p>
  </li>
  <li>Waldâ€™s Equality: Let ${X_n;n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of IID rvâ€™s, each of
mean $\bar{X}$. If J is a stopping trial for ${X_n;n\geq 1}$ and if $E[J]&lt;
\infty$, then the sum $S_J=X_1+X_2+\cdots + X_J$ at the stopping trial J
satisfies <br />
\(E[S_J]=\bar{X}E[J]\)</li>
  <li>Generalized Waldâ€™s Equality:
is independent and identically distributed(IID) to all other pairs. Assume
that each X_i has finite mean $\bar{X}$. If J is a stopping trial for ${
 (X_n,V_n); n \geq 1   }$
    <h4 id="proof">Proof</h4>
    <p>\(\begin{aligned} \mathrm{E}\left[S_{J}\right] &amp;=\sum_{n} \mathrm{E}\left[X_{n}
\mathbb{I}_{J \geq n}\right] \\ &amp;=\sum_{n} \mathrm{E}\left[X_{n}\right]
\mathrm{E}\left[\mathbb{I}_{J \geq n}\right] \\ &amp;=X \sum_{n}
\mathrm{E}\left[\mathbb{I}_{J \geq n}\right] \\ &amp;=X \sum_{n}^{n}
\operatorname{Pr}\{J \geq n\}=\overline{X E}[J] \end{aligned}\)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>E(XY)=E(X)E(Y) if X and Y are independent.</li>
      <li>If you are playing a fair game, your expected gain is the expected gain for
trail times the expected number of times you play.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="application-of-walds-equality">Application of Waldâ€™s Equality</h4>
<p>Consider the possibly-defective stopping trial J where is the first n for which
$S_n=X_1+\cdots +X_n=1$, the first trial at which the gambler is ahead.<br />
According to Waldâ€™s equality<br />
\(E[J]=\frac{1}{X}=\frac{1}{2 p-1}\)</p>
