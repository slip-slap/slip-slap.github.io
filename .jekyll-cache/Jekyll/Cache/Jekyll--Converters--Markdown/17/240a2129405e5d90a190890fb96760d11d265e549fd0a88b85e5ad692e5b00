  <li>
    <p>a human has $10^11$ neurons to facilitate your reading, breathing, motion and
thinking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a neurons have three princpal components: the dendtrites, the cell body and
the axon.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Some of the neural structures is defined at birth. Others are developed
through learning, as new connections are make and others wates away</li>
  <li>It has been shown that if a young cat is denied use of one eye during a
critical windown time, it will never develop normal vision in that eye.</li>
  <li>Linguists have discovered that infants over six months of age can no longer
discriminate certain speech sounds.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>biological neurons are very slow when compared to electrical circuits$(10^-3) compared
to 10^-10). The brain is able to perform many tasks much faster than any
conventional computer.</li>
