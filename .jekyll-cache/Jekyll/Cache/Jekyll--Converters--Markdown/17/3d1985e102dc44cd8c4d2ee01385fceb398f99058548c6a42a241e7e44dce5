<p>In some ways, tuples are like lists, they are a way to store several values into
a single value.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A list of numbers is a list of numbers. Thatâ€™s its type and it doesnâ€™t matter
if it has only one number in it or an infinite amount of numbers.</li>
  <li>Tuples, however, are used when you know exactly how many values you want to
combine and its type depends on how many components it has and the types of
the components.</li>
</ul>
