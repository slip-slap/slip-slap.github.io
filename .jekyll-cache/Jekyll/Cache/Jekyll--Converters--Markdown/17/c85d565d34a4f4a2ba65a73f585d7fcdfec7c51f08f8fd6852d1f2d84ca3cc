  <li>Ideal Intervention:  One approach to modeling causal relationships is using
the notion of ideal interventions-interventions of the of the form do(Z:=z),
which force the variable A to take the value z, and have no other immediate
effect.</li>

  <li>In practice, however, there is a huge set of possible latent variables,
representing factors that exist in the world but that can not observe and
often are not even aware of. A latent variable may induce correlations
between the observed variables that do not correspond to causal relations
between them, and hence forms a confounding factor in our goal of determining
causal interactions.</li>
