<p>Use adverbs and commas to fine-tune your sentences, to produce highly specific meanings at the sentence level.
Explore multiple ways to convey your meaning, even to moving words around in your sentences.</p>

<h4 id="1">1.</h4>
<p>We don’t use comma to separate single-word adverb from the word they modify.</p>

<h4 id="adverb-location">Adverb location</h4>
<p>Some of the fun in playing with adverbs is moving them around a sentence.
While adverbs that modify adjectives and other adverbs must come immediately
before the adjective or adverb, there are options when an adverb modifies a
verb. We can put the adverb near the verb, but we don’t have to. All of the following cases work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quickly she raced to the hospital.</li>
  <li>She quickly raced to the hospital.</li>
  <li>She raced quickly to the hosptial.</li>
  <li>She raced to the hospital quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sentence-verb">Sentence verb</h4>
<p>Sentence adverbs are different from typical adverbs. They reflect the attitude,
opinion, or judgement of the speaker. This is the writer, speaker, or thinker
revealing himself through a word choice.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sadly, Cinderella didn’t make it to the ball that year.</li>
  <li>Frankly, I didn’t think he could do it.</li>
</ol>

<p>These adverbs aren’t modifying the verb or another modifier; they applt to the
sentence as a whole.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sentence adverbs can go at the end of a sentence or clause rather than at
the beginning. In the end position, they may come across as an afterthough or parenthetical.</li>
  <li>This use at the end of a clause may create a more informal feel to the sentence.
    <ul>
      <li>I didn’t think he could do it, frankly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="adverbial-phrases">Adverbial phrases</h4>
<p>We often use a comma to separate multiword adverbial phrases or clauses from
the rest of the sentence when the phrase or clause comes first.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over the course of a very long night, the surgeon operated on three children.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="remark">Remark</h5>
<p>The use of commas after prepositional phrases isn’t always straightforward. We
use a comma after some prepositional phrases at the beginning of a sentence but
not after others.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a comma after prepositional phrases of five or more words, use a comma to
eliminate confusion.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="conjunctive-adverbs">Conjunctive adverbs</h4>
<p>Conjunctive adverbs are one more type of adverb that can function as sentence adverbs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A common use for them is to connect independent clauses within a sentence.
When used for this purpose, the conjunctive adverb follows a semicolon and
is followd by a comma.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Dudley didn’s like beans; however, he ate them in order to get his favourite dessert.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Conjunctive adverbs can also come at the beginning of a sentence, connecting
not two independent clauses in one sentence.
    <ul>
      <li>Pat lost the instruction. Moreover, no one knew how to operate the danged machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
