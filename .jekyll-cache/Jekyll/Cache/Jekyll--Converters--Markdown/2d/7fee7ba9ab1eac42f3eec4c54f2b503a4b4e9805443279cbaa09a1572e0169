<p>math can be divided into four parts, structure, space, change, application, and
discrete.
<img src="/images/math.png" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Difference between space and structure</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>\(R^N\), Banach space, Normed vector space, Metric space, Hilbert space,
 Inner product space, vector space. modern mathematics uses many types of
 spaces.  it does not define the notion of ‚Äúspace‚Äù itself</li>
  <li>Neither of these words space and structure have a single mathematical
 definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same
 situations, but you often think of a ‚Äúspace‚Äù as more geometric and a
 ‚Äústructure as more algebraic. So you could thinke of ‚Äústructures‚Äù as places
 we do algebra, and ‚Äúspaces‚Äù we do geometry.</li>
  <li>The distinction between geometric ‚Äúspace‚Äù and algebraic ‚Äústructure‚Äù is
 sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, groups are algebraic, while
 Euclidean spaces are geometric.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-notation">3 Notation</h4>

<h5 id="31-greek-alphabet">3.1 Greek Alphabet</h5>

<p><img src="/images/math-greek-alphabet.jpg" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>\(\xi \mapsto p_{\xi}\): sign between \(\xi\) and \(p_{\xi}\) means maps to</li>
  <li>\(\xi\) and \(\Xi\) prounced |zai| in English, prounced |ksi| in modern
Greek.</li>
  <li>\(\phi\) or \(\varphi\)  and  \(\Phi\), these two letters are the same, but little change</li>
  <li>\(\psi\) and \(\Psi\), usually stands for wave function in quanum mechanics.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="32-change-mathematics">3.2 Change Mathematics</h5>
<ul>
  <li>\(\partial\): denote as a partial derivative such as \(\frac{\partial
z}{\partial x}\).</li>
  <li>It represents a specialized cursive letter of d. It may simply pronounced
 simply ‚Äúdee‚Äù.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="33-applied-mathematics">3.3 Applied Mathematics</h5>

<ol>
  <li>Probability and Statistics
    <ul>
      <li>$\Pi$ denotes a finite set of objects, $\pi$ denotes a member in the set.</li>
      <li>X denoted a real-valued functions(sometimes called a measurement)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="brackets">brackets</h5>
<ol>
  <li>curly brackets: {} which means the order doesn‚Äôt matter.</li>
  <li>square brackets: [] the order matters.</li>
  <li>tilde $ \tilde $ means: denote an equivalence between two objects.x $ \tilde $y</li>
  <li>raised asterisk $*$: used to denote adjoint.</li>
  <li>hat over letter: used to denote an estimated value, as opposed to its
theoretical counterpart, for example, in the context of errors and residuals,
the ‚Äúhat‚Äù over the letter $\epsilon$ indicates an observable estimate (the
residuals) of an unobservable quantity called $\epsilon$(the statistical
errors).</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h4 id="reference">Reference</h4>
<ol>
  <li>you often think space more geometric, such as metric space, Hilbert space,
norm space. structure more algebraic, such as in group theory.</li>
</ol>
