<p>The analysis phase of a compiler breaks up a source program into constituent pieces and produces an
internal representation for it, called intermediate code.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The synthesis phase translates the intermediate code into the target machine.</li>
</ul>

  <li>A set of terminal symbols, sometimes referred to as ‚Äútokens‚Äù</li>
  <li>A set of nonterminals, sometimes called ‚Äúsyntactic variables‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>Each nonterminal represents a set of string of terminals, in a manner we shall describe.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A set of productions, where each production consistt of a nonterminal called the head or left
side of the production, an arrow, and sequence of terminals and/or nonterminals, called the body
or right side of the production
    <ul>
      <li>The intuitive intent of a production is to specify one of the written forms of a construct</li>
      <li>If the head nonterminal represents a construct, then the body represents a written form of the
construct.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
