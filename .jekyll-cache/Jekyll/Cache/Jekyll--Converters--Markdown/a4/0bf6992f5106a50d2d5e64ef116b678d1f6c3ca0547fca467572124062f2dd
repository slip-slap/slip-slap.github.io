<p>You need have a git soul when you use git.</p>

<p>You are not in a default file system, itâ€™s new, and complete different.</p>

<p>You go to file source, copy it to the destination when you use the classic file
system, in which the source is a directory.</p>

<p>In git, you still go to the source when you want get something back, but it is
not a directory any more, itâ€™s a commit. you go to a commit, and you get
something back. Keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Thinking things differently is realy a beautiful thing.</p>
