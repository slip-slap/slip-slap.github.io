<ol>
  <li>There is no difference between astronomer and mathimatican, all mathimatican
are insterested in astronomy, and all astronomers are mathimaticans.</li>
  <li>Greeks, Archimedes</li>
  <li>Indias</li>
  <li>Arabs</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="concept">Concept</h4>
<p>Why we are so interested in sphere, because the celestial sky, the moon, the sun
are all sphere.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The term sphere refers to only to the surface itself, if we want to talk about
the region in this sphere, we use the term  ball.</li>
  <li>Analogous to the circular objects in two dimensions, where a circle
circumscribes its disk.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="line">Line</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In Euclidean geometry, a line is shortest path though two points.</li>
  <li>The equator shown here is the intersection of the sphere S with a plane P
through the center O.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Lines d,f,g are concurrent \(Leftrightarrow\) they pass through a common point
A.</li>
  <li>Poins A,B,C are collinear \(Leftrightarrow\) they lie on a common line d.</li>
  <li>A triangle $ \overline{ABC}$ is a set {A,B,C} of three non-collinear
points.</li>
  <li>A trilateral $\overline{dfg}$ is a set {d,f,g} of three non-concurrent lines.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>On a big sphere, the geometry looks close to Eucliden: lines, points,
circles,perpendicularity.</p>
<ol>
  <li>How do we measure?</li>
  <li>How is Euclidean geometry modified?</li>
  <li>Do we have midpoints, Pythagoras, orthocenters, circumcircles?</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Any two points A, B can be joined by a unique line unless $B=\overline{A}$</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="haha">HAHA</h4>
<p>n-sphere: in mathematics, the n-sphere is the generalization of the ordinary
sphere to spaces of arbitrary dimension, it is an d-dimensional manifold that
can be embedded in Euclidean (n+1)-space.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The 0-sphere is a pair of points.</li>
  <li>The 1-sphere is a circle.</li>
  <li>The 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere.</li>
  <li>Generally, when embeded in an (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space, an n-sphere
is the surface or boundary of an (n+1)-dimensional ball.</li>
</ol>
