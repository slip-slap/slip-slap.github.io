<ol>
  <li>we have linear search, its time complexity is $\Theta (n)$</li>
  <li>we have binary search, its time complexity is $log_2^n$</li>
  <li>The problem is: we need more, we donâ€™t satisify with the current situation,
we need more, how about constant time, can we do it? give it a shot.</li>
  <li>The solution is <strong>hashing</strong> !!! Just constant time, are you excited ? letâ€™s
began our journey.</li>
</ol>

<p>####</p>
<ol>
  <li>simple uniform hashing</li>
</ol>

<p>####</p>
<ol>
  <li>Expected length of chain for k keys, m slots:  n over m, called $\alpha$, the
load factor of the table.</li>
</ol>
