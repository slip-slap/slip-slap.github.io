<h4 id="t">/t/</h4>
<p>Its pronounciation has two cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When it appears in a sentence, such as the last /t/ in <em>nice to meet you</em>, it
still make some voiceless sound. But it is different from a standard /t/
sound, We make this sound by stoping the air flow from throat to the mouse,
and this action will make a sound.</li>
  <li>A standard /t/.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="can-and-cant">Can and can’t</h4>
<p>The pronounciation of <em>can</em> is more smooth than <em>can’t</em>, since <em>can’t</em> needs
stop the air flowing from throat into mouth.  So the sound of <em>can’t</em> is more
abrupt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lyric <em>Hello, can you hear me? Hello from the outside.</em> sounds beautifully
and smoothly if pronounce it correctly. Please relax you mouth when you try to
make this.</li>
</ul>
