<p>Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and
related theories, such as differentiation, integration, infinite series. <br />
Analysis evolved from calculus, which involves the elementary concepts and
techniques of analysis. Analysis may be distinguished from geometry; howerver,
it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of
nearness(a topological space) or specific distances between objects (a metric
space).</p>

  <li>$ \forall $ means for all  For examle:$ \forall n \in \mathbb{N} : n^{2}
\geq n $</li>
  <li>$ \exists $ means there exists For example: $\exists n \in \mathrm{N} : n
\text { is even } $</li>
  <li>$ \Leftrightarrow $ means the same as For example: $ x+5=y+2
\Leftrightarrow x+3=y $</li>

<p>$d(xy)=xdy+ydx$</p>

<p>$
(x+dx)(y+dy)-xy=xdy+ydx+dxdy
$</p>
<ol>
  <li>Leibniz think $dxdy$ are too small, you can get rid of them.</li>
  <li>at that time the concept of ‚Äúlimit‚Äù havn‚Äôt appear. Newton has the same idea.</li>
  <li>As far as I am concerned, if you get rid of something, such as $dxdy$, and
they are not equal zero, the result will not be accurate.</li>
  <li>but the fact is opposite, it is <strong>accurate</strong>, although, there are some flaw
with this theorem. The result is <strong>accurate!!!</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-does-arithmetical-consist-of-">What does arithmetical consist of ?</h4>
<p>Addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and take roots <br />
J$\cdot$Gregory thinks that limit operation is also an arithmetical operation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>When I first use the calculus to calculate the area under a curve, I am
confused, because, obviously, we ignore something.
    <ul>
      <li>Actually, here in this part, a new concept is introduced, it‚Äôs called
<strong>infinitesimal</strong>.</li>
      <li>This thing is not zero, if it was zero, we just call it zero.</li>
      <li>This thing is a complete new math object.</li>
      <li>With a new math object, like a function, we want to know how do they composite together?</li>
      <li>Can we add them together?</li>
      <li>Can we do the multiplication?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Actually, math is just math object, and how to manipulate them.
    <ul>
      <li>how to compute, how to composition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
