<p>There are a few Latin terms that are still commonly used in English scholarly writing.</p>

<h4 id="eg">e.g.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>When â€œe.g.â€ is used, it implies that there are other examples not mention in
the list. Here are some examples:
    <ul>
      <li>The Summer Olympics is composed of a variety of sports(e.g., gymnastics, swimming, and tennis)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It can be used interchangeably with â€œfor exampleâ€ or â€œsuch asâ€.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="common-mistakes">Common mistakes</h5>
<p>One common mistake is using with â€œetc.â€ in the same sentence. Because e.g.
implies that other examples are being omitted.</p>

<h4 id="ie">i.e.</h4>
<p>I.e. is the abbreviation for the Latin phrase id est, meaning â€œthat is.â€
This is used when you want to specify something mentioned previously.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It can be used interchangeably with â€œspecificallyâ€ or â€œnamely.â€</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Every students should learn the two basic methodologies in the field, i.e.,
