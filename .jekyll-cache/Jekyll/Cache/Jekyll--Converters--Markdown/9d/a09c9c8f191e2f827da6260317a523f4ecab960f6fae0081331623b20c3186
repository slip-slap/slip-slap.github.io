<h4 id="what-is-a-pull-request">What is a pull request?</h4>
<p>You make local code changes and then submit those changes to a remote project
maintainer for review before those changes implemented, or merged.</p>

<p>This is called a pull request; you are requesting that someone reviews and
approves your changes before then become final.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-do-this">How to do this?</h4>
<p>After forking the repository on the remote hosting service and cloning it to
your local machine, you can start working on making changes to the code.</p>

<p>After youâ€™re happy with the changes, you can push the work up to your fork and
open a full request that will signal the main repo. This pull request asks the
maintainer to review your work, provide comments, request edits.</p>
