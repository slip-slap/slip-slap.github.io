<p>Tensor is multi-dimensional array of numbers: such as scalar, vector, matrix.</p>

<h5 id="12--version-two">1.2  Version two</h5>
<p>Tensor is an object that is invariant under a change of coordinates, and has
components tat change in a special, predictable way under a change of
coordinates</p>
<ul>
  <li>Like a pencil in space, it doesnâ€™t change no matter in which coordinates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tensor is a collection of vectors and covectors combined together using the
tensor product.</p>

  <li>Tensor Fields: If to each point of a region in N dimensional space
corresponds a definite tensor, we say that a tensor field has been defined,
This is a vector field or a scalar field according as the tensor is of rank
one or zero. It should be noted that a tensor or tensor field is not just the
set of its components in one special coordinates system but all the possible
sets under any transformation of coordinates.</li>
