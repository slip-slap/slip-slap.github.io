<p>There are many situations in which, along with a renewal process ${N(t); t &gt;
0}$, there is another randomly varying functions of time, called a reward
function ${R(t); t&gt;0}$.</p>
<ul>
  <li>$R(t)$ models a rate at which the process is accumulating a reward.</li>
  <li>We shall illustrate many examples of such processes and see that a ‚Äúreward‚Äù
could also be a cost or any randomly varying quantity of interest.</li>
  <li>The important restriction on these reward functions is that $R(t)$ at a given
t depends only on the location of t within the inter-renewal interval
containing t and perhaps other random variables local to that interval.</li>
</ul>
