<ol>
  <li>The derivative is the rate of change of y, as times goes forward, are partly depending on the solution itself.
    <ul>
      <li>That’s the idea of differential equation.</li>
      <li>It connect the changes with the function y as it is.</li>
      <li>and then you have $q(t)$ which produces their own change. They go into the system, and the become part of the y.</li>
      <li>and they grow, decay, oscillate, whatever y of t does.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can think of y as money in the bank,  growing, decaying, oscillating.</li>

  <li>In Newton’s law, the force is the multiplicaton of mass and acceraltion, that’s why we have the first item.</li>
  <li>$by^{\prime}$ could be some damping. If I have motion, there are some friction slowing it down. That depends on the first derivation, it’s verlociy.</li>
  <li>$ky$ refers some force term.</li>
  <li>$f(t)$ some outside force injecting into the system, some person or machine creating the movement.</li>
</ol>
