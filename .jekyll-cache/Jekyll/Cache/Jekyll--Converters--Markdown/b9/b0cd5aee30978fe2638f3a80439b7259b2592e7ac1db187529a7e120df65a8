<h4 id="normed-division-algebra">Normed Division Algebra</h4>
<ol>
  <li>There are only four normed division algebra, which are Real numbers, Complex
numbers, Quaterion, Octonions.</li>
  <li>Vector space are only defined over field.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="algebra">Algebra</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A field has to have a norm to form an algebra, a norm is always great then
zero.</li>
  <li>Given a norm, we can have some topology.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="notation">Notation</h4>
<ol>
  <li>$S_n$: short for symmetry groups</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="therom">Therom</h4>
<p>Every finite group(gp) G is a subgroup of $S_n$ (for some n)</p>
