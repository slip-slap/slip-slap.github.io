<h4 id="extended-real-number-system">Extended Real Number System</h4>
<p>The extended real number system $R^\asterisk$ is the real line $R$ with two
additional elements attached, called $+\infty$ and $-\infty$.</p>
<ul>
  <li>These elements are distinct from each other, and also distinct from every real
number.</li>
  <li>An extended real number is $x$ is called finite iff it is a real numer, and
infinite iff it is equal to  $+\infty$ or $-\infty$.</li>
  <li>These new symbols $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, at present do not have much meaning,
since we have no operations to manipulate them.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>we define $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, but there are only limit operations on
these two elements.</li>
  <li>Our knowledge is so limited.</li>
</ol>
