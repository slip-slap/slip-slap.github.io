  <li>Each node can broadcast its cost to its descendants once it knows the costs
of all its possible predecessors.</li>
  <li>The cost of <strong>A</strong> is zero, we pass this news on to <strong>H</strong> and <strong>I</strong>., as the
message passes along each edge in the graph, the cost of that edge is added.
We find the costs of H and I are 4 and 1 respectively. figure(a)</li>
  <li>what about <strong>K</strong>, out of the edge <strong>H-K</strong> comes the message that a path of
cost 5 exists from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>K</strong> via <strong>H</strong>; and from edge <strong>I-K</strong> we learn
of an alternative path of cost 3 figure(b)</li>
  <li>The min-sum algorithm sets the cost of <strong>K</strong> equal to the minimum of these,
and records which was the smallest-cost route into <strong>K</strong> by retaining only
hte edge <strong>I-K</strong> and pruning away the other edges leading to K, fiugre(c)</li>

  <li>One reason that graph theory is important is because we can use graph 
to complete some calculation.</li>
  <li>Message-passing rule-set A and message-passing rule-set B just make use the
structure of the graph and do some math.</li>
  <li>At first, I read the phrase â€œmessage-passing rule-set Aâ€, I donâ€™t know how to
separate the sentence, it should be like this â€œmessage-passing ruleâ€ for â€œset
Aâ€. I just need a lot of time to understand something.</li>
