<ol>
  <li>A minimal connected graph: deleting any edge disconnects it</li>
  <li>Cut Vertex: graph can be disconnected by the deletiong of one vertex, its cut
vertex</li>
  <li>Vertex Cut: A vertex cut of G is a subset $V^{\prime}$ of V such that $G-V^{\prime}$
is disconnected.
    <ul>
      <li>A k-vertex cut is a vertex cut of k elements</li>
      <li>A complete graph has no vertex cut.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Block: A connected graph that has no cut vertices is called a block</li>
</ol>
