<p>The formula be written as
	$a=b+1$,
	$c=m^2$,
where 
	$a=1$,
	$b=2$.</p>

<h4 id="template-2">Template 2</h4>
<p>From equation (2.94), the stress in the local are given by</p>

<p>$a = b + c$,
$c = d + f$,</p>

<p>where d and f are in units of MPa.</p>

<h4 id="template-3">Template 3</h4>
<p>Newtonâ€™s second law of motion, ma=f, is maybe one of the first differential equations written.</p>

<p>####</p>
<ol>
  <li>The negation of 3 is -3.</li>
  <li>Similarly, we let X denotes this variable.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="percent-and-percentage">Percent and Percentage</h4>
<ol>
  <li>percent is always associated with a specific number.</li>
  <li>percentage is to refer to a general relationship rather than a specific number.</li>
</ol>

<p>We use Sk to denote the set of symmetric k Ã— k matrices, Sk
to denote the set of symmetric positive semidefinite k Ã— k matrices, and Sk
to denote the set of symmetric positive definite k Ã— k matrices.</p>
