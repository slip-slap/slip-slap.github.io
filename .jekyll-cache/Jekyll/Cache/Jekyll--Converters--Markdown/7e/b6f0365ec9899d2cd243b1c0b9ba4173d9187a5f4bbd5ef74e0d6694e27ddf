    <p>As an important example, the optimization problem is called a linear program if
the objective and constraint functions $f_0,\cdots, f_m$ are linear, i.e.,
satify $a+b &lt; 1$ for all $x,y \in R^n$.</p>

    <p>It has a number of statistical interpretations, e.g., as maximum likelihood
estimation of a vector x, given linear measurements corrupted by Gausian
masurement errors.</p>
