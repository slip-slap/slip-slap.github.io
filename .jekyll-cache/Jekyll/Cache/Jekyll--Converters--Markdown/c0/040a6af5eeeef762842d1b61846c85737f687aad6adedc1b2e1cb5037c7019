I"ß<h4 id="1-commands">1. commands</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Commands for composing paragraphs: deal with characters, words, lines, and entire paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Commands for composing pages: deal with pages, their components, and the output routine.</li>
  <li>Commands for horizontal and vertical modes: These commands provide boxes, spaces, rules, leaders, and alignments.</li>
  <li>Commands for composing math formulas: provide capabilities for constructing math formulas.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="2-control-sequence">2. Control sequence</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A control word consists of a backslash followed by one or more letters
    <ul>
      <li>The first character that isn‚Äôt a letter marks the end of the control word.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-active-character">1. Active character</h4>
<p>An active character is a character that has a definition, e.g., a macro definition, associated with it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An active character is a special kind of control sequence</li>
  <li>If Tex encounters an active character that does not have an associated definition,
it will complain about an undefined control sequence.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-alignment">2. alignment</h4>
<p>An alignment is a construct for aligning material, such as a table, in columns
or rows. To form an alignment you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>describe the layout of the columns or rows</li>
  <li>tell Tex what material goes into the columns or rows</li>
  <li>To skip down two inches, you would type ‚Äò\vskip 2in‚Äô, where 2in is the argument of \vskip.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="3-argument">3. argument</h5>
<p>An argument contains text that is passed to a command.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The arguments of a command complete the description of what the command is supposed to do.</li>
  <li>The command can either be a primitive command or a macro.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-glue">4. Glue</h4>
<p>Glue is blank space that can stretch or shrink.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Glue gives Tex the flexibility that it needs in order to produce handsome documents</li>
  <li>Horizontal glue: occurs within horizontal lists</li>
  <li>Vertical glue: occurs within vertical lists.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="41-muglue">4.1 muglue</h5>
<p>Muglue is a kind of glue that you can use only in math formulas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is measured in mu(mathematical units).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-box">4. box</h4>
<p>A box is a rectangle of material to be typeset.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A single character is a box by itself, and an entire page is also a box.</li>
  <li>Tex forms a page as a nest of boxes with boxes with boxes.</li>
  <li>The outermost box is the page itself</li>
  <li>The inntermost boxes are mostly single characters</li>
  <li>Single lines are boxes that are somewhere in the middle.</li>
  <li>A line is a box containing a sequence of character boxes, and a page is a box containing a sequence of line boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-category-code">5. category code</h4>
<p>The category code of a character determines that character‚Äôs role in Tex</p>
<ul>
  <li>For instance, Tex assigns a certain role to letters, another to space characters.</li>
  <li>Tex attaches a code to each character that it reads. When Tex reads the
letter ‚Äòr‚Äô, for example, it ordinarily attaches the category code 11 to it.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-groups">6. Groups</h4>
<p>A group consists of material enclosed in matching left and right braces({ and })</p>
<ul>
  <li>By placing a command within a group, you can limit its effects to the material within the group.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-anatomy-of-tex">3. Anatomy of Tex</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using its ‚Äúeyes‚Äù, Tex reads characters from input files and passes them to
its mouth. Since an input file can contain \input commands.</li>
  <li>Using its mouth, Tex assembles the characters into tokens and passes them to its gullet.</li>
  <li>Using gullet, Tex expands any macros, conditionals, and similar constructs
that it finds and passes the resulting sequence of tokens to Tex‚Äôs stomach.</li>
  <li>Using stomach</li>
  <li>Using its intestines, Tex transforms the pages produced by its stomach into a
form intended for processing by other programs, it then sends the transformed
output to the .dvi file.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Tex is a programming language.</li>
</ol>
