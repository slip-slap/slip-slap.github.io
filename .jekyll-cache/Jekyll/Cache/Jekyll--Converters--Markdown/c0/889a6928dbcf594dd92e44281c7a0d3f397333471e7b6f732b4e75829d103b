  <li>$\nabla {f}$ obtains a vector</li>
  <li>$df$  obtains a covector
    <ul>
      <li>For a very very long time, I just canâ€™t understand why $df$ is a covector,
because as soon as I see the sign $df$, the expression such as \(3dx+5dy+6dz\)
come into my mind, thatâ€™s the form of \(df\), thatâ€™s calculation process of
$df$, you should focus on the result of the $df$, itâ€™s just a number.</li>
