<ol>
  <li>In contrast to the geometric definition of derivatives, which uses tangents</li>
  <li>The advantage of working analytically is we do not need to know the axioms of
geometry</li>
  <li>These definitions can be modified to handle functions of several variables,
or functions whose values are vectors instead of scalar.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, one’s geometric intuition becomes difficult to rely on once one
has more than three dimensions in play.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="remark">Remark</h4>
<p>One sometimes writes $\frac{df}{dx}$ instead of $f^\prime$. This notation is of
course very familiar and convenient, but one has to be a little careful, because
it is only safe to use as long as x is the only variable used to represent the
input for f; <strong>otherwise one can get into all sorts of trouble.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>function $f: R \rightarrow R$ defined by $f(x):=x^2$ has derivative $\frac{df}{dx} = 2x$
but the function $g: R \rightarrow R$ defined by $g(y) := y^2$ would seem to
have derivative $\frac{dg}{dy} = 0$ if y and x are independent variables</li>
  <li>despite the fact that g and f are exactly the same function.</li>
  <li>because of this possible source of confusion, we will refrain from using the
notation $\frac{df}{dx}$ whenever it could possibly lead to confusion</li>
  <li>This confusion becomes even worse in the calculus of several variables. There
are ways to resolve these ambiguities, most notably by introducing the notion
of differentiation along vector fields.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="chain-rule">Chain Rule</h4>

<h5 id="remark-1">Remark</h5>
<ol>
  <li>If one writes y for f(x), and z for g(y), then the chain rule can be written
in the more visually appealing manner 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d z}{d x} = \frac{d z}{d y} \frac{d y}{d x}
\end{equation}
    <ul>
      <li>However, this notation can be misleading(for instances it blurs the
distinction between dependent variable and independent variable, especially
for y)</li>
      <li>and leads one to believe that the quantities $dz, dy, dx$ can be manipulated
like real numbers. However, these quantities are not real numbers</li>
      <li>In fact, we have not assigned any meaning to them at all, and treating them as
such can lead to problems in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Remember the first time I saw the derivative about a vector, I lost myself,
what’s this ? look at this monster, I have no idea what does this mean ?</li>
  <li>I should take with analyticall definition, more abstract, more elegant, more
fundamental.</li>
</ol>
