<p>Much of this chapter will be devoted to understanding the behavior of N(t) and
N(t)/t as t becomes large.</p>

<h4 id="renewal-processes-and-poisson-process">Renewal Processes and Poisson Process</h4>

<ol>
  <li>A renewal process is an arrival process for which the interarrival intervals
$X_1,X_2,\cdots$ are IID. Renewal processes can be specified in three standard
ways.
    <ul>
      <li>the names come from that you start over at each interval.</li>
      <li>The joint distribution of the arrival epochs $S_1,S_2,\cdots$</li>
      <li>The joint distribution of the interarrival times $X_1,X_2,\cdots$</li>
      <li>The joint distribution of the counting rvâ€™s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A Poisson process is a renewal process for which the interarrival rvâ€™s are
exponential</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="remark">Remark</h5>
<ol>
  <li>The interarrival are the things that are independent, and the arrival epochs
are the sum of the interarrival intervals.
    <ul>
      <li>if you know that the first arrival epoch takes 10 times longer than its mean,
then that the second arrival epoch is going to be kind of long, too.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="convergence-of-sequences">Convergence of Sequences</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A sequence $b_1,b_2,\cdots$ of numbers is said to converge to a limit b if
for each real $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there is an integer m such that$|b_n -b|
    \leq\epsilon$ for all $n\geq m$.
    <ul>
      <li>Using the convergence of numbers to be able to talk about convergence of random
variables, and convergence of random variable is indeed not a simple problem.</li>
      <li>For convergence in distribution, it is not the rvâ€™s but the distribution of
the rvâ€™s that converge</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="result-of-renewal-process">Result of Renewal Process</h4>
<ol>
  <li>For each sample point $\omega \in \Omega$, $N(t,\omega)/t$ is a nonnegative
number for each t and ${N(t,\omega);t&gt;0}$ is a sample path of the counting
renewal process, taken from (0,t] for each t. Thus \(\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} N(t, \omega) / t\)
if it exists,is the time-average renewal rate over $(0,\infty)$ for the
    sample point $\omega$</li>
  <li>E[N(t)/t] also approaches $1/\bar{X}$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$</li>
</ol>
