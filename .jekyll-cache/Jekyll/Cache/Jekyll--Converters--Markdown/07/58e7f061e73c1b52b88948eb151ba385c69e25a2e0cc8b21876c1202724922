<ol>
  <li>In some domains, the amount of knowledge required is just too large or the
expert’s time is too valuable. In others, there are simply no experts who
have sufficient understanding of the domain. In many domains, the properties
of the distribution change from one application site to another or over time,
and we cannot expect an expert to sit and redesign the network every few
weeks.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="goals-of-learning">Goals of Learning</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In practice, the amount of data we have is rarely sufficient to obtain an
accurate representation of a high-dimensional distribution involving many
variables. Thus, we have to select \(\tilde{\mathcal{M}}\) so as to
construct the “best” approximation to \(\mathcal{M}^{*}\). The notion of
“best” depends on our goals. Different models will
generally embody different trade-offs.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="model-constraints">Model Constraints</h4>
<ol>
  <li>We may not know the structure, and we have to learn both parameters and
structure from the data.</li>
  <li>Even worse, we may not even know the complete set of variables over which the
distribution \(\mathcal{P}^{*}\). In other words, we may only observe some
subset of the variables in the domain and possibly be unaware of others.</li>
