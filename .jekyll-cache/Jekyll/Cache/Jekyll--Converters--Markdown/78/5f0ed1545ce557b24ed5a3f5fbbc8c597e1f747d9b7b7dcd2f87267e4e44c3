<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Differential forms are generalizations of real-valued functions on a manifold.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of assigning to each point of the manifold a number, a differential
k-form assigns to each point a k-covector on its tangent space.</li>
  <li>For k=0 and 1, differential k-forms are functions and covector fields
respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>Differential forms play a crucial role in manifold theory.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First and foremost, they are intrinsic objects associated to any manifold, and
so can be used to construct diffeomorphism invariants of a manifold.</li>
  <li>In constrast to vector fields, which are also intrinsic to a manifold,
differential forms have a far richer algebraic structure. Due to the existence
of the wedge product, a grading, and the exterior derivative.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exterior-derivative">Exterior Derivative</h4>
<p>In contrast to undergraduate calculus, where the basic objects of study are
functions, the basic objects in calculus on manifolds are differential forms.
<strong>Our program now is to learn how to integrate and differentiate differential
forms</strong></p>
