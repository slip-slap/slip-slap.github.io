<p>Newtonâ€™s method is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better
approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.  The most basic version
starts with a single-variable function f defined for a real variable x. <br /></p>

\[x_{1}=x_{0}-\frac{f\left(x_{0}\right)}{f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)}\]
