  <li>the primary goal in the geometric theory of curves is to measure their shapes
in ways that do not take into account how they are parametrized or how
Euclidean space is coordinatized</li>
  <li>However, it is generaly hard to measure things without coordinatizing space
and parametrizing the curve.</li>
  <li>Thus the idea will be to see if some sort of canonical parametrization might
exist and secondly to also shwo that our measurements can be defined using
whatever parametrization the curve comes with</li>
  <li>We will also try to make sure that our formulas do not necessarily refer to a
specific set of Cartesian coordiantes.</li>
</ol>
