  <li>The output of a recurrent network could converge to a stable point, oscillate,
or perhaps even diverge.
    <ul>
      <li>So our objective is to determine whether a particular set of nonlinear
equations has points(or trajectories) to which its ouput might converge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recurrent networks are potentially more powerful than feedforward networks,
since they are able to recognize and recall temporal, as well as spatial,
patterns.
    <ul>
      <li>The behavior of these recurrent networks is much more complex than that of
feedforward networks</li>
      <li>for feedforward networks, the output is constant(for a fixed input) and is a
function only of the network input. For recurrent networks, however, the
output of the network is a function of time.</li>
      <li>For a given input and a given initial network ouput, the response of the
network may converge to a stable output or not.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
