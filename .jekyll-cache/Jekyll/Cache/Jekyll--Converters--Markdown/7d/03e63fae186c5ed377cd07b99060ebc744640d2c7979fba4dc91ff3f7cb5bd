<p>We donâ€™t use comma to separate single-word adverb from the word they modify.</p>

<h4 id="adverb-location">Adverb location</h4>
<p>Some of the fun in playing with adverbs is moving them around a sentence.
While adverbs that modify adjectives and other adverbs must come immediately
before the adjective or adverb, there are options when an adverb modifies a
verb. We can put the adverb near the verb, but we donâ€™t have to. All of the following cases work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quickly she raced to the hospital.</li>
  <li>She quickly raced to the hospital.</li>
  <li>She raced quickly to the hosptial.</li>
  <li>She raced to the hospital quickly.</li>
</ul>
