  <li>
    <p>Suppose you want to evaluate a stream of cash flows extending over a number of years. The present
value is:
$
\mathrm{PV}=\frac{C_{1}}{(1+r)}+\frac{C_{2}}{(1+r)^{2}}+\frac{C_{3}}{(1+r)^{3}}+\cdots+\frac{C_{T}}{(1+r)^{T}}
$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Net Present Value(NPV):
$
\mathrm{NPV}=C_{0}+\mathrm{PV}=C_{0}+\sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}
$</p>
