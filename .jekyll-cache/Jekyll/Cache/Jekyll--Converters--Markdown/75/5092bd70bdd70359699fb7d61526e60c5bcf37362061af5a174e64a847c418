  <li>By default, Makefile targets are â€œfile targetsâ€. they are used to build files
from other files. Make assumes its target is a file, and this makes writing
Makefiles relatively easy.</li>
  <li>sometimes you want your Makefile to run commands that do not represent
physical files in the file system. Good examples for this are the common
targets â€œcleanâ€ and â€œallâ€. Chances are this isnâ€™t the case, but you may
potentially hava a fine named <strong>clean</strong> in you main directory, in such a case
Make will be confused because by default the <strong>clean</strong> target would be
associated with this file and Make will only runit when the file doesnâ€™t
appear to be up-to-date with regards its dependencies</li>
  <li>These special targets are called <strong>phony</strong> and you can explicitly tell Make
theyâ€™re not associated with files.
    <ul>
      <li>In terms of Make, a phony target is simply, a target that is always
out-of-date. it will run, independent from the state of the file system.</li>
    </ul>
