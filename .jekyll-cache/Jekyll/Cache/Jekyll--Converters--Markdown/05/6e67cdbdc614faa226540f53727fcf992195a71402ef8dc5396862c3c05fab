<p>Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and
related theories, such as differentiation, integration, infinite series. <br />
Analysis evolved from calculus, which involves the elementary concepts and
techniques of analysis. Analysis may be distinguished from geometry; howerver,
it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of
nearness(a topological space) or specific distances between objects (a metric
space).</p>
