<p>What <em>git rebase</em> does is modify the record of commit history. In nature, it
modify the commits.</p>

<p>This operation works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches(the one
youâ€™re on and the one youâ€™re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each
commit of the branch youâ€™re on</p>
<ul>
  <li>saving those diffs to temporary files</li>
  <li>resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing
onto, and finally applying each change in turn.</li>
</ul>
