  <li>Theorem: Assume that ${Z_n; n\geq 1}$ converges to $\alpha$ WP1 and assume
that f(x) is areal valued function of a real variable that is continuous at
$x=\infty$. Then $x=\alpha$. Then ${f(Z_n);n\geq 1}$ converges WP1 to
$f(\alpha)$

      <li>Random Variables are far more complicated things, because of that they have more
ways that they can approach limits.</li>
