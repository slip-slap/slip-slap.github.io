  <li>Why bother stochastic processes? what’s the logical purposes behind why these are done?</li>
  <li>A practical Problem</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>These are signals collected from a sensor, because of noise, each time, we obtained different signals</li>
  <li>The questions are</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>what if we want to know the averaged value at $t_1$ ? how can we calculated this?</p>
  </li>
  <li>If we take a vertical line to cut through at $t_1$, the result we get is a collection of random numbers.
    <ul>
      <li>so we can treat all the values we obtain at $t_1$ as the value of  a random variable, can we?</li>
      <li>of course we can, so we can use the theory we developed in probability to study it’s property.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What if we want to ask the relationship between the random variable $X_{t1}$ and $X_{t2}$?
    <ul>
      <li>what’s the relationship</li>
      <li>so stochastic process can be treat as the functions of random variables.</li>
      <li>At each time slot, we take a vertical line, we get a random variable, and all this random variables form the stochastic process.</li>
      <li>for the very simple bernoulli process, all the random variable all the same, they have the same distribution.</li>
      <li>but it doesn’t need to be like this.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Stochastic processes which are processes that proceed randomly in time.</li>
  <li>We consider sequences $X_0,X_1,X_2,\cdots$ where $X_n$ represents some random
quantity at time n.
How do you prevent oil spills? <br />
How do you prevent nuclear plants from going off?<br />
How do you prevent nuclear weapons from falling in the hands of the wrong people?<br />
These again, are probability issues.<br />
If you say there is one change in a billion that something will happen, 3/4 people will say
that’s not acceptable. <strong>I don’t want any risk, these people are fools</strong>, but unfortunately,
these fools outnumber those of us who have studied these issues.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="set-theory">set theory</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Sample space: there elements in that sample space</li>
  <li>events:   events are subsets of the sample space.</li>
  <li>sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points –from Merriam Webster</li>
  <li>according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, it’s a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.</li>

  <li>probability and statistics is an apply subject. Knowledge we learn in
calculus, and set theory all can be used in this subject.</li>
  <li>Gamma function is from calculus, Jacobian matrix is also from calculus. They
all can be used to study probability and statistics.</li>
  <li>What’s the difference between stochastic process and probability model?
    <ul>
      <li>In probability, you generate a sampling point one time.</li>
      <li>In stochastic process, you generate a sampling path one time.</li>
      <li>If you treat probability as function, because its factor is a variable.</li>
      <li>the stochastic is functional, becasue its factor is a function.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
