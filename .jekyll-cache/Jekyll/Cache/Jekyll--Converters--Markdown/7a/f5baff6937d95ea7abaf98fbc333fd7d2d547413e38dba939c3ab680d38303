<p>Context Free languages provide a superset of the regular languages, if you can specify a class of
patterns with a regular expression, you can express the same language using a context free grammar.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Examples of languages that are context free, but not regular, include the set of all strings
representing common arithmetic expressions, legal Pascal or C source files, and MASM macros</li>
  <li>Context free languages are characterized by balance and nesting, for example, arithmetic
expression have balanced sets of parenthesis. High level language statements like repeatâ€¦ until
allow nesting and are always balanced.</li>
</ol>

<p>A context free grammar contains two types of symbols: terminal symbols and nonterminal symbols.</p>
<ol>
  <li>terminal symbols are the individual characters and strings that the context free grammar matches
plus the empty string, $\epsilon$.</li>
  <li>Context free grammars use nonterminal symbols for function calls and definitions</li>
</ol>
