<h4 id="em-algorithm">EM algorithm</h4>

<p>EM is an algorithm for maximum the likelihood function</p>

<p><strong>广义EM算法，E步骤是固定参数优化隐分布，M步骤是固定隐分布优化参数,可以用GMM算作为类比</strong></p>

<h4 id="jensens-inequality">Jensen’s inequality</h4>
<p>Jensen’s inequality generalizes the statement that the secant line of a convex lies above the graph of the function.
which in Jensen’s inequality for two points. The Jensen’s inequality is(for \(t\in[0,1]\)):</p>

\[f\left(t x_{1}+(1-t) x_{2}\right) \leq t f\left(x_{1}\right)+(1-t) f\left(x_{2}\right)\]

<p>in the context of probability, it is generally stated in the following form, if X is a random variable and 
\(\varphi\) is a convex function</p>

\[\varphi(\mathrm{E}[X]) \leq \mathrm{E}[\varphi(X)]\]
