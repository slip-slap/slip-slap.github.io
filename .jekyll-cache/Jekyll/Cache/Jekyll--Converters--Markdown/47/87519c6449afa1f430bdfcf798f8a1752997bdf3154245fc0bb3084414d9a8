<p>Base class constructos are automatically called for you if they have no
argument.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument, you must use
subclass’s constructor initialization list.</li>
  <li>Unlike Java, C++ supports multiple inheritance, so the base class must be
referred to by name, rather than “super()”</li>
</ol>
