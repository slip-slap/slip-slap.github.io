  <li>matching: A subset M of E is called a matching in G if its elements are links
and no two are adjacent in G
    <ul>
      <li>the two ends of an edge in M are said to be matched under M.</li>
      <li>A matching M saturates a vertex v, and v is said to be <strong>M-saturated</strong>,
otherwise, v is <strong>M-unsaturated</strong>.</li>
      <li>If every vertex of G is M-saturated, the matching M is perfect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>M-alternating path: An M-alternating path in G is a path whose edges are
alternately in E\M and M.</li>
  <li>M-augementing path: an M-augmenting path is an M-alternating path whose
origin and terminus are M-unsaturated.</li>
</ol>

  <li>covering: A covering of a graph G is a subset K of V such that every edge of
G has at least one end in K.</li>
  <li>minimum covering: A covering K is a minimum covering if G has no covering
$|K^{\prime}|&lt;|K|$

<p>In a certain company, n workers $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$ are available for n jobs
$Y_1,Y_2,\cdots,Y_n$, each worker being qualified for one or more of these jobs.
can all the men be assigned, one man per job, to jobs for which they are
qualified?</p>

  <li>Just as the other branches in mathematician. we are trying to divide the
graph to very very small concept, such as mathing, covering, bond, block,
independent set. I think maybe it is also another <strong>group theory</strong></li>
