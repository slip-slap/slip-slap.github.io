<p>Probability is the science of uncertainty. It provides precise mathematical
rules for understanding and analyzing our own ignorance.
The content of probability and statistics can be divided into three parts</p>
<ol>
  <li>Probability Model(P.M.)</li>
  <li>Probability and Statistics Model Inference(P.A.S.M.I.)</li>
  <li>Probability and Statistics Model Check(P.A.S.M.C.)</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-probability-model">1. Probability model</h4>
<p><strong>A probability model</strong> consists of a nonempty set called the sample space
$\Omega$; a collection of events $\mathcal{F}$ that are subsets of $\Omega$;
and a probability measure $\mathbf{P}$ assigning a probability between 0 and 1
to each event.  $ (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P}) $</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Sample Space</strong>: A sample space is any set that lists all possible outcomes(or, responses) of
some unknown experiment or situation,
 <strong>which is a set whose elements are called outcomes or sample points.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Probability Measure</strong>: usually written P. This probability measure must
assign, to each event A, a probability P(A).</li>
  <li>$A^c$: if A is any event, we write $A^c$(read ‚ÄúA complement‚Äù) for the event
that A does not occur.
\(P(A^c)=1-P(A)\)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The second component of a probability model is a class of events, which can be
considered for now simply as the class of all subsets of the sample space.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="11-remark">1.1 Remark</h5>
<p>We must familiar with some terms, such as sample point, is same as outcome.</p>

<h4 id="2-random-variable">2. Random Variable</h4>
<ol>
  <li>random variable: defined by a function that associates with each outcome in
$\Omega$ a value.
    <ul>
      <li>We will usually use uppercase roman letters X,Y,Z to denote random variables,
use a lowercase letter to refer to a value of a random variable.</li>
      <li>We use Val(X) to denote the set of values that a random variable X can take.</li>
      <li>For example, <strong>Grade</strong> is defined by a function $f_{Grade}$ that maps each
person in $\Omega$ to his or her grade(say, one of A,B,or C)</li>
      <li>The event $Grade=A$ is a shorthand for the event${\omega \in \Omega: f_{Grade}(\omega)=A}$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>random variables: 
Complex systems are characterized by the presence of multiple interrelated
aspects, for example, in medical diagnosis application, there are multiple
possible diseases that the patient might have, hundreds of symptoms and
diagostic tests. These domains can be characterized in terms of a set of random
variables.
    <ul>
      <li>random variables, just a set of random variable</li>
      <li>we can denote the random variables as $\mathcal{X}$, and each element which
also a random variable denoted as $X_i$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Although I use this term <strong>random variable</strong> for a pretty long time, Actually, I
have no interpretation of this crap at all.</p>

<h5 id="21-remark">2.1 Remark</h5>
<p>As with any function, there is often confusion between the function itself,
which is called X in the definition above, and the value $X(\omega)$ the
function takes on for a sample point $\omega$.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is particularly prevalent with random variables(rv‚Äôs) since we
intuitively associate a rv with its sample value when an experiment is performed.</li>
  <li>We try to control that confusion here by using $X, X(\omega), $ and $x$,
respectively, to refer to the rv, the sample value taken for a given sample
point $\omega$, and a generic sample value.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="terminology">terminology</h4>
<ol>
  <li>statistic: a statistics or sample statistic is any quantity computed from
values in a sample, often mean. Technically speaking, a statistic can be
calculated by applying any mathematical function to the values found in a
sample of data.</li>
  <li>Marginal Likelihood: in statistics, a marginal likelihood function or
integrated likelihood, is a likelood in which some parameter variables have
been marginalized. In the context of Bayesian statictics, it may also be
referred to as the evidence or model evidence.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>For a new subject, if you want to master it. You must get used to with the
basic concept and the notation, and what does they mean.</li>
  <li>The purpose of probability theory and statistics is to study a special kind of function, random variables  why
it is so special, because you can‚Äôt evaluate the function at some specific
point. For example, $y=x^2$, you can evaluate the value of the function at
every x, you get an y. but for the random variable mapping  the result of tossing a dice to a real number ${1,2,3,4,5,6}$,
for this very special function, the meaningful thing is to calculate the
    expectation and variance.</li>
  <li>So random process and probabilit and statistics just the subject evaluate
expectation and variance.</li>
  <li>To study geometry, we introduce calculus, and now, to study probability, we
also need to use calculus, calculus just a tool can be used in geometry and
probability.</li>
