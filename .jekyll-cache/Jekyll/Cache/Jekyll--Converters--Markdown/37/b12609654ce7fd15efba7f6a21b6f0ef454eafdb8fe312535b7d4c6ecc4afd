  <li>Stationary Dynamical System: we say that a Markovian dynamic system is
stationary (also called time invariant or homogeneous), if $P(\mathcal{X}^{(t+1)}|\mathcal{X}^{(t)})$ is
the same for all t. In this case, we can represent the process using a
transition model $P(\mathcal{X}^{\prime} | \mathcal{X})$, so that, for any $t\geq 0$ <br />
\(P\left(\mathcal{X}^{(t+1)}=\xi^{\prime} |
\mathcal{X}^{(t)}=\xi\right)=P\left(\mathcal{X}^{\prime}=\xi^{\prime} |
\mathcal{X}=\xi\right)\)</li>

  <li>Stochastic processes is an important part of probability and statictics, it
focus on a variable which is time.</li>
  <li>Probabilistic graphical models also can be splited into two different parts,
variable-based model and templated-based model.</li>
