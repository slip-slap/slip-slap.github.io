<p>‚ÄúSince Newton, mankind has come to realize that the laws of physics are always expressed in the language of differential equations.‚Äù -Stenven Strogatz</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>Suppose an object begins to move at the speed $v_0$, it subjects to
gravitational force, calculate its trajectory.</p>

<ol>
  <li>step one: $\frac{d^2y}{dt} = -g$</li>
  <li>step two: $\frac{dy}{dt} = -gt+v_0$</li>
  <li>final: $y = -0.5gt^2 + v_0t$</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="example-2-pendulum">Example 2: pendulum</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Accerlate: $a = \frac{d^2y}{x} = -gsin(\theta)$</li>
  <li>$x=$</li>
  <li>$a = L\theta  = -gsin(\theta)$</li>
  <li>add air resistance: $\frac{d^2\theta}{t} = -\mu \frac{d\theta}{dt} - \frac{g}{L}sin(\theta (t)) $</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>The derivative is the rate of change of y, as times goes forward, are partly depending on the solution itself.
    <ul>
      <li>That‚Äôs the idea of differential equation.</li>
      <li>It connect the changes with the function y as it is.</li>
      <li>and then you have $q(t)$ which produces their own change. They go into the system, and the become part of the y.</li>
      <li>and they grow, decay, oscillate, whatever y of t does.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
