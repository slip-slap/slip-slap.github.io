<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>A key problem of the Grossberg network and the competitive networks is that they
do not always form stable clusters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grossberg did show that if the number of input patterns is not too large, or
if the input patterns do not form too many clusters relative to the number of
    neurons in Layer 2, then the learning evntually stabilizes.</li>
  <li>He also showed the standard competitive networks do not have stable learning
in response to arbitrary input patterns</li>
  <li>The learning instability occurs because of the network’s adaptability(or
plasticity), which causes prior learning to be eroded by more recent learning.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="stabilityplasticity-dilemma">Stability/plasticity Dilemma</h4>
<p>How can a system be receptive to significant new patterns and yet remain stable
in response to irrelevant patterns?</p>
<ul>
  <li>We know biological systems are very good at this. For example, you can easily
recognize your mother’s face, even if you have not seen her for a long time
and have met many new people in the mean time.</li>
</ul>
