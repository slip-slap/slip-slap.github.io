<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>A Lie group is, roughly speaking, a continuous group, that is, a group described
by several real parameters. In this book, we consider matrix Lie groups, which
are Lie groups realized as groups of matrices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider the set of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices with determinant 1, denoted
$ \mathrm{SL}(2 ; \mathbb{R}) $</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a">A</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>General Linear Group over the real numbers, denoted 
$ \mathrm{GL}(n ; \mathbb{R}) $, is the group of all $n \times n$ invertible
matrices with real entries. The general linear group over the complex numbers,
denoted 
$ \mathrm{GL}(2 ; \mathbb{C}) $, is the group of all $n \times n$ invertible
matrices with complex entries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $ M_{n}(\mathbb{C}) $ denote the space of all $n \times n$ matrices with
complex entries</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
<p>Lieâ€™s original motivation was to study the group of transformations of a space
as a continuous analogue of the group of permutations of a finite set.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indeed, a diffeomorphism of a manifold M can be viewed as a permutation of the
points of M.</li>
  <li>The Interplay of group theory of group theory, topology, and linear algebra
makes the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras a particularly rich and
vibrant branch of mathematics.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="application">Application</h4>
<p>In manifold theory, Lie groups serve mainly as an importatn class of manifolds,
and Lie algebras as examples of tangent spaces.</p>
