<p>We can <strong>LEARN FROM DATA</strong> through Bayesâ€™ theorem.</p>

<h4 id="remark">Remark</h4>
<p>Probability theory and graph theory are get involved in this study, which are
two different subject. Some natural questions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does a concept also exists in graph theory which exists in probability theory?</li>
  <li>suppose it exists, How do we relate the concepts with them?</li>
  <li>For example, the conditional independence concept? Does it exist in graph
theory? How are we going to define it? How exactly are they relate to each
other.</li>
  <li>All the properties we develop in DAG are for probability distribution.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Why bother a graph? We want to know the relationship, causal relationship or
correlation relationship,  whatever it is.</li>
