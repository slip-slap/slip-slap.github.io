<p>OpenGl is by itself a large state machine: a collection of variables that define
how OpenGL should currently operate.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The state of OpenGL is commonly referred to as the OpenGL context</li>
  <li>Just a fancy terminology</li>
  <li>We often change its state by setting some options, manipulating some buffers
and then render using the current context.</li>
  <li>When working in OpenGl we will come across several state-changing functions
that change the context and several state-using functions that perform some
operations based on the current state of OpenGL.</li>
  <li>As long as you keep in mind that OpenGL is basically one large state machine,
most of its functionality will make more sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>An object in OpenGL is a collection of options that represents a subset of
OpenGL’s state.</p>

  <li>Most implementations are built by graphics card manufactures. Whenever there is a bug in the
implementation is usually solved by updating your video card drivers; those drivers include the
newest versions of OpenGL that your card supports. This is one of the reasons why it’s always
advised to occassionally update your graphic drivers.</li>
