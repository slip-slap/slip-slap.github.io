<h4 id="whats-all-about">Whatâ€™s all about?</h4>
<p>Structure is nothing but composition, create element from old to new.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Binary operation is composition,</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>We prefer concept which are from intuition, such as the tangent line of a curve
at a specific point, it is easy to understand.</li>
  <li>Speaking of structure, itâ€™s not something intuitive, itâ€™s pure mathematics</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>for example, in real anaysis, we build structure addition of two numbers.</li>
  <li>To mimick this property, we add structure on complex domain, what does it
mean? I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s just the structure we want to adopt.</li>
  <li>we can also adopt $\sigma$ and $\delta$ to define limit on complex number
domain.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-is-algebra">What is algebra?</h4>
<p>We already get used to addition, multiplication, and division. All the
operations manipulate two elements, so they are called binary operation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why the operation has to be binary? Could it be unary,n-ary ? Yes, it can.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>From linear algebra, bool algebra, lattice theory, group thoery, to lie
algebra. We came a long way. But there are some pattern among them.
    <ul>
      <li>construction: we, people, human being, our understanding is very limited. We
can only understand something very basic, and we believe complex things are
build based on simple pattern, isnâ€™t that our limitation. Anyway, in number
theory, the construction is simple 1 + 1  = 2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
