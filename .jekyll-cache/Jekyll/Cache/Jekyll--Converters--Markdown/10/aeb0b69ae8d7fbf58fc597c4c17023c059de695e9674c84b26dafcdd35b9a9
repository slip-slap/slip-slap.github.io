<p>Of course, he is a racist, it will course hatred between Chinese and American.
The local will discrimate chinese American, but why trump tweeted like this?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Because he want to be elected again, The president election is coming, his
potential opponent Biden has some bussiness in China, and Trump want to use
this to defeat Biden,</li>
  <li>The other reason is he don’t want to take responsibility at all. American
people will belame China for the bad econemy, but not Donald Trump.</li>
  <li>The lesson I can learn from this event is if <strong>you want to defeat you opponent,
The most important thing is to figure out what he want to, and this make
sense, in all relationship</strong></li>

<h4 id="mayun-donated-masks-and-test-kits-to-american">Mayun: donated masks and test kits to American.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Mayun is not just a businessman, he needs to service the RPC.</li>
  <li>The amount Mayun is a piece of iceberg, what does he want, just show some
kindness, he is not stupid, he is not an angel.</li>
  <li>His donation will cases big problem for American, how to fairly distribute
this masks to everyone, and now all Ameircan people know China has masks and
test kits. So the goverment can’t contine lie to people, we don’t have test
kits.</li>
