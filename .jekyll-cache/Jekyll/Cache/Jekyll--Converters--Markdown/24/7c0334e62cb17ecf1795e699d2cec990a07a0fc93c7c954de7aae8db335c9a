  <li>Sample space: there elements in that sample space</li>
  <li>events:   events are subsets of the sample space.</li>
  <li>sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points –from Merriam Webster</li>
  <li>according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, it’s a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.</li>

\[(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})\]

      <li>All these things about stochastic process just about the property of this function.</li>
      <li>if $t$ is fixed, this item refers to a random variable at time $t$.</li>
      <li>if $\omega$ is fixed, this item refers to a sample function.</li>
