  <li>Stochastic Process is a collection of random variables indexed by time, this
is the formal definition of stochastic process</li>
  <li>Given the $DP(\alpha, H(0))$, a point is generate from this thing, and this
point itself is a random variable, so we call this thing $DP(\alpha, H(0))$ 
Dirichlet Process. Because it meet the definition of a process.</li>
