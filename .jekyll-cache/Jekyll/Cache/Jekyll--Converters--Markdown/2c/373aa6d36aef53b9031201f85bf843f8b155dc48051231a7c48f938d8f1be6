<p>This is a very common question, but it is not simple.</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<ol>
  <li>we use vector coordinate to solve this problem.</li>
  <li>Given the two line, suppose they have intersect point</li>
  <li>We can obtain the intersection point.</li>
  <li>The last step is to determine weather this point is on the line</li>
  <li>we can again use affine geometry with vector to deal with this
$
\vec{OC}=\vec{OA} + \lambda \vec{AB}
$
Based on the value of $\lambda$, we can determine whether this point is on the
line.</li>
</ol>

<p>The naive method to determine whether a point is a plane it compare the
coordinate value. That’s a method, but but but, it’s so naive. <br />
But with math tool, you see it, math is beautiful, math is great, I love math.</p>
