<ol>
  <li>You will find references to the term ‚Äúmachine‚Äù throughout automata theory literature. This term
does not refer to some particular computer on which a program executes</li>
  <li>This is usually some function that reads a string of symbols as inpus and produces one of tho
outputs: match or failure</li>
  <li>Each class of machine has a class of languages associated with it. Deterministic and
nondeterministic finite state auotomata recognize the regular languages. Nondeterministic push
down automata recognize the context free languages. Turing machines can recognize all
recongnizable languages.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="derivation">Derivation</h4>
<p>The set of all strings that can be derived from a Grammar is said to be the language generated from
that Grammar</p>

  <li>When I write a program to identify legal parenthesis, stack is indispensable. According to theory
of computation, this program is a pushdown automata.</li>
