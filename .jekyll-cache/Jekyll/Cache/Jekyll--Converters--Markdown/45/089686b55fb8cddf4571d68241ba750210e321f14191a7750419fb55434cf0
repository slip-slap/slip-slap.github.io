<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<p>The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism;
that is, given a particular group, we should be able to match it up with a known
group via an isomorphism.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order n is
isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}_n$</li>
  <li>Hence, we ‚Äúknow‚Äù all finite cyclic groups. It is probably not reasonable to
expect that we will ever know all groups;</li>
  <li>However, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between
groups in special cases.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="morphism">Morphism</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Homomorphism
    <ul>
      <li>In algebra, a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type, such as groups, rings, or vector spaces</li>
      <li>A field homomorphism is a map from one field to another one which is additive, multiplicative, zero-preserving, and unti-preserving.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Isomorphism
    <ul>
      <li>A bijection f such that both f and its inverse $f^-1$ are homomorphisms, that is, structure-preserving mappings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Endomorphism
A homomorphism that maps a system to itself</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="equality-relation">Equality relation</h4>
<p>Let R be the relation on Z defined as follows: for all $a,b \in Z$, $a R b$ if
and only if $a=b$, this equality relation on Z has the following properties.</p>
<ol>
  <li>For each $a \in Z$, a=b and so $a R a$</li>
  <li>For all $a, b \in Z$, if $a=b$, then $b=a$. That is, if $a R b$, then $b R a$</li>
  <li>For all $a, b, c \in Z$, if $a=b$ and $b=c$, then $a=c$, that is, if $a R b$ and $b R c$, then $a R c$</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="equivalence-relations">Equivalence relations</h4>
<p>Let A be nonempty set and let R be a relation on A.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The relation R is reflexive on A provided that for each $x \in A$, $x R x$ or, equivalently, $(x,x) \in R$
    <ul>
      <li>This means that if a reflexive relation is represented on a digraph, there would have to be a loop at each vertex</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>The relation R is symmetric provided that for every $x, y \in A$, if $x R
y$, then $y R x$, for every $x, y \in A$, then $(y,x) \in R$
    <ul>
      <li>This means that if a symmetric relation is represented on a digraph, then
anytime there is a directed edge from one vertex to a second vertex, there
would be a directed edge from the second vertex to the first vertex.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/math-structure-abstract-algebra-group-structure-symmetry.png" height="" width="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>The relation R is transitive provided that for every $x,y, z \in A$, if $x R
y$ and $y R z$, then $x R z$, or equivalently, for every $x,y,z \in A$, if
$(x,y) \in R$ and $(y,z) \in R$, then $(x,z) \in R$
    <ul>
      <li>If a transitive relation is represented by a digraph, then anytime there is a
directed edge from a vertex x to a vertex y, and a directed edge from y to a
vertex y to a vertex z, there would be a directed edge from x to z.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
