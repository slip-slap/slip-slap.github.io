<p>Expressing y in the form 
$y= x_2 + \theta(x_2 - x_1)$
gives another interpretation: y is the sum of the base point $x_2$
(corresponding to $\theta=0$) and the directiion $x_1 - x_2$ (which points from
x_2 to x_1) scaled by the parameter $\theta$.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The reader can refer to any of the standard texts on convex analysis.</li>
  <li>The notation $x_i$ can refer to the ith component of the vector x, or to the
ith element of a set or sequence of vectors.</li>
  <li>
    <p>We refer to a point of the form $a+b=1$, where a=2, as an affine combination
of the points a and b.</p>
  </li>
  <li>With a slight abuse of notation, we will also refer to
\(\begin{array}{cl}\operatorname{maximize} &amp; f_{0}(x) \\ 
\text { subject to } &amp; f_{i}(x) \leq 0, \quad i=1, \ldots, m \\ 
&amp; a_{i}^{T} x=b_{i}, \quad i=1, \ldots, p
\end{array}\)
as a convex optimization problem if the objective function $f_0$ is concave.</li>
</ol>
