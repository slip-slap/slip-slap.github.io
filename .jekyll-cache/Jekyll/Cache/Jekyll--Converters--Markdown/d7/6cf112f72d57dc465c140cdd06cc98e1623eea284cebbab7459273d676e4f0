  <li>chain: is going to be a word for random element in this free abelian group of
random combination  with integer coefficient.</li>
  <li>boundary: final point minus initial point</li>
</ol>

<p>Every Connected graph X has a spanning tree which includes all vertices.
A tree with V vertices always has v-1 edges.</p>
