<p>Git is all about the three trees: working directory, index, and HEAD, and all
the operations is for them.</p>

<p><img align="left" src="/images/git-three-trees.png" /></p>

<h4 id="13-git-status">1.3 git status</h4>
<p>Comparing these trees, and show their difference.</p>

<h4 id="14-git-add">1.4 git add</h4>
<p>Tracking new files, it essentially add this file to index tree.</p>

<h5 id="12-git-clone">1.2 git clone</h5>
<p>This command is git clone and not “checkout”. This is an important
distinction-instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of
nearly all data that the server has.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by
default when you run git clone</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="15-ignoring-files">1.5 Ignoring Files</h4>
<p>Often, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add
or even show you as being untracked.</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> .gitignore
<span class="k">*</span>.[oa]
<span class="k">*</span>~
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li>the first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in “.o” or “.a”</li>
  <li>the second line tells git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde(~)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="16-git-diff">1.6 git diff</h4>
<p>The git status is too vague for you, you want to know exactly what you changed,
not just which files were changed. you can use git diff.</p>
<ul>
  <li>git diff shows you the exact lines added and removed-the patch</li>
</ul>
