<h4 id="sampling">Sampling</h4>
<p>Sampling is important in simulation, and the methods vary a lot according to the
target distribution. The cases are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The most basic case is a the probability distribution with one random
variable, for both continueous variable and discrete variable. There are two
solutions:
    <ul>
      <li>Inversion method for generating random variables.</li>
      <li>Construct a sophisticated random variable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In some cases, the probability distribution is not fully understand, and only
part of it is accessible. Researchers develop the following trick for
different cases.
    <ul>
      <li>Only the ratio of the probability of any two values of a random variable is
known: MCMC</li>
      <li>Multiple random variables get involved: Gibbs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="probability-theory-vs-statistical-model">Probability theory vs statistical model</h4>
<p>Probabiliy theory is primarily concerned with calculating various quantities
assosiated with a probabiliy model. This requires that we know what the correct
probability model is.</p>

<p>In application, this is often not the case, and the best we can say is that the
correct probability measure to use in a set of possible probabiliy measures. We
refer to this collection as the statistical model.</p>
<ul>
  <li>So, in a sense, our uncertainty has increased; not only do we have the
uncertainty associated with an outcome or response as described by a
probability measure, but now we are also uncertain about what the probability
measure is.</li>
</ul>
