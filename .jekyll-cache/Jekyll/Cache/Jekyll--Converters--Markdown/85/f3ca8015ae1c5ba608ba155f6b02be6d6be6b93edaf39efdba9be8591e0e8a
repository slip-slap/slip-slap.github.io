<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Sets with a single binary operation satisfying certain axioms</li>
  <li>We are often more interested in working with sets that have two binary
operations
    <ul>
      <li>If we consider a set with two such related binary operations satisfying
certain axioms, we have algebraic structure called a ring.</li>
      <li>In a ring, we add and multiply elements such as real numbers, complex numbers,
matrices, and functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>Ring:  A ring is a set of elements under $\times, -,+$, not commutative under $\times$</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ring with Unity or idenity: if there is an element  $1 \in R$ such that $
1 \neq 0
$ and $1a=a1=a$ for each element $a\in R$, we say that R is a ring with unity or
identity</li>
  <li>Commutative ring: A ring R for which $ab=ba$ for all a,b in R is called a
commutative ring.</li>
  <li>Integral domain: A commutative ring R with identity is called an integral
domain if, for every $a,b \in R$ such that ab=0, either a=0 or b=0.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Integer: Every Integer is a product of primes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matrix
 $2\times 2$ matrix, $a,b,c,d \in R \times$.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>$ 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		a &amp; b <br />
		c &amp; d  <br />
	\end{bmatrix}
$
rings generalize matrix, which are pretty important.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Intergers  are ring.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="polynomial">Polynomial</h4>
<p>Polynomials with coefficients
Every Polynimial is a product of irreducible polynomials(instead of prime polynomials) <br />
$
x^{15}-1=(x-1)\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}{x^{8}-x^{7}+x^{5}-x^{4}}{+x^{3}-x+1}\end{array}\right)
$</p>

<h4 id="remark">Remark</h4>
<p>When I begin to learn math, the operation 0 divides a number confuses me a lot. <br />
After talent French mathematician comes out group theory, everything change. In the point of view of group theory, you can treat everything you 
meet as group with additive structure. For example, real numbers under operation addition is a group, totally true.
but you want to add multiply structure to this group, Itâ€™s Ok, I accept your proposal, and then give it a new name,
we call it a ring.</p>
