<p>The concept of probability has a rich and diversified history that includes many
different philosophical approcaches. Notable amont these approaches include the
notions of probability as a ratio, as a relative frequency, and as a degree of
belief.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In 1933 A.N. Kolmogorov developed the set-theoretic definition of
probability, which serves as a mathematical foundation for all applications
of probability.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="remark">Remark</h4>
<p>Both relative frequency and degree of belief are our intuitives from the real
world, obviously, which are different concept. Can you find an interpretation to
unify these two intuitives. Here is set-theoretic definition to play, which is
more abstract, insightful, and concise. And relative frequnecy and degree of
belief are two implemenation of this definition from two different respective.<br />
It needs insight to come up with something fundamental, which makes you a great
mathematician.</p>

<h4 id="probability-theory-vs-statistical-model">Probability theory vs statistical model</h4>
<p>Probabiliy theory is primarily concerned with calculating various quantities
assosiated with a probabiliy model. This requires that we know what the correct
probability model is.</p>

<p>In application, this is often not the case, and the best we can say is that the
correct probability measure to use in a set of possible probabiliy measures. We
refer to this collection as the statistical model.</p>
<ul>
  <li>So, in a sense, our uncertainty has increased; not only do we have the
uncertainty associated with an outcome or response as described by a
probability measure, but now we are also uncertain about what the probability
measure is.</li>
</ul>
