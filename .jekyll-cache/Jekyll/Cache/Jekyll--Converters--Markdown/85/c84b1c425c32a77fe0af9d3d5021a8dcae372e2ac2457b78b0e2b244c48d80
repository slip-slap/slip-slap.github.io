<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>It is a familiar fact from vector calculus that line and surface integrals
depend on the orientaion of the curve or surface over which the integration
takes place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reversing the orientation changes the sign of the integral</li>
  <li>the goal of this section is to define orientation for n-dimensional manifolds
and to investigate various equivalent characterizations of orientation.</li>
</ul>
