<h4 id="ai">AI</h4>
<p>AI: first coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, <strong>AI involues machings that can
perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence.</strong>, while this is
rather general, it includes things like planning, understanding language,
recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem-solving.</p>

<h4 id="ml">ML</h4>
<p>ML: First coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, defining it as, ‚Äúthe ability to learn
without using being explicitly programmed.‚Äù 
Machine Learning is simply a way of achieving AI.</p>
<ul>
  <li>the term ‚Äúexplicitly programmed‚Äù, how to understand, for example, in tradional
image recognition, if you want to identify an apple, the first step is check
the shape of the target, maybe you need create a convex hull surround the
target, and based on the convex hull, you decided it‚Äôs an apple or not.</li>
  <li>But with machine learning, you don‚Äôt need to do like that, you just let the
computer to find the pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dl">DL</h4>
<p>DL: Deep learning is one of many approaches to machine learning. other
approaches include decision tree learning, clustering, reinforcement learning,
and Bayesian networks.</p>
