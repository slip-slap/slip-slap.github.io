<ol>
  <li>Direct map to hardware
    <ul>
      <li>of instructions and fundamental data types</li>
      <li>initially from c</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Zero-overhead abstraction
    <ul>
      <li>classes with constructors and destructors, inheritance, generic programming,
functional programming techniques</li>
      <li>initially from Simula</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Much of the inspiration came from operating system</li>

  <li>C++ is a beast, it has two many features Macro, OOP, GP. It doesnâ€™t mean we
have to use them. Why C++ is so flexible, because it has two stages,
compile,liner. During the two stages, you can do a lot staff, acutally many
fancy grammer exists, just because the two stages.</li>
  <li>The first thing that differentiate from any othe language is mapping
operationg to hardware, the second is zero-overhead</li>
  <li>If C++ want to continue its advantage in programming language, it must adapt
to new hardware, and make use of them.</li>
</ol>
