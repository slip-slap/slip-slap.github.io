<p>If H is a subgroup of a group G, then right cosets are not always the same as
left cosets; that is, it is not always the case that $gH=Hg$ for all $g \in G$.
The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group
theory. They allow for the construction of a new class of groups.</p>
