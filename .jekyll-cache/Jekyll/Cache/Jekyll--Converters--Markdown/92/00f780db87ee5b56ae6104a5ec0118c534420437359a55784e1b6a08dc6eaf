<ol>
  <li>a set of outcomes \(\mathcal{O}=\left\{o_{1}, \ldots, o_{N}\right\}\)</li>
  <li>a set of possible actions that the agent can take, \(\mathcal{A}=\left\{a_{1}, \dots, a_{K}\right\}\)</li>
  <li>A probabilistic outcome model \(P: \mathcal{A} \mapsto \Delta_{\mathcal{O}}\), which defines a lottery $\pi_{\alpa}$, which specifies a probability
distribution over outcomes given that the action was taken.</li>
  <li>a utility function \(U: \mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathbb{R}\), where $U(o)$ is the agentâ€™s preferences for the outcome $o$.</li>
</ol>
