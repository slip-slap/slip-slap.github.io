<ol>
  <li>Positive Define: a symmetric $n\times n$ real matrix M is said to be positive
definite if the scalar $z^T Mz$ is strictly positive for every nonzero column
z of n real numbers.</li>
  <li>Indefinite: A matrix that is not positive semi-definite and not negative
semidefinite is called indefinite.</li>
  <li>Positive Semi-define: the scalars $z^T Mz$ or $z^{\aster} Mz$ must jbe
positive or zero. <strong>Negative Definite and Negative Semi-define</strong> are defined
analogously.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-is-intuitive-explanation-of-a-positive-semidefine-matrix">what is intuitive explanation of a positive semidefine matrix</h4>
<p>One intuition definition as follows. Multiply any vector with a positive
semi-definite matrix.  The angle between the  original vector and the resultant
vector will always be less or equal \(\pi/2\) The positive define matrix tries
to keep the vector within a certain half space containing the vector.  This is
analoous to what a positive number does to a real number.  Multiply it and it
only stretches or contracts but never reflects it about the origin</p>

  <li>In Lie Group and Lie Algebra, special matrix is studied. For example, the
volume preserving matrix, <strong>Positive Define Matrix</strong> can be treated as a
special kind of matrix.</li>
  <li>Why we are so interested in this kind of matrix, because it can use to
calculate inner product in high dimensional space, which <strong>means distance</strong>.</li>
