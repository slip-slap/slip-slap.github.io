  <li>why data is modified by private ? function is modified by public?
    <ul>
      <li>just like a car, it has button you can push, the button is like a function,
itâ€™s public.</li>
      <li>But whatâ€™s in the button, you have no idea. Itâ€™s the data which is private.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Static class members are treated almost exactly like global variables/functions. Because they are
not tied to an instance.
    <ul>
      <li>There is nothing to discuss regarding memory layout.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Class member variables are duplicated for each instance as you can imagine, as each instance can
have its own unique value for every member variable.</li>
  <li>Class member functions only exist once in a code segment in memory. At a low level, they are just
like normal global functions but they receive a pointer to this. With Visual studio on x86, itâ€™s
via ecx register using thiscall calling convention.</li>
</ol>
