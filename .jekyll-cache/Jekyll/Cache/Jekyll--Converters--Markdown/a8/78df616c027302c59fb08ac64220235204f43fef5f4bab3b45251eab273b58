<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization. It shares with other threads
belonging to the same process its code section, data section, and other
operating system resources, such as open files and signals.
    <ul>
      <li>A thread ID</li>
      <li>A program counter</li>
      <li>A register set</li>
      <li>A stack</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="benefits">Benefits</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Utilization of multiprocessor: the benefits of multithreading can be greatly
increased in a multiprocessor architecture, where the thread maybe running in
parallel on different processors. A single-threaded process can only run on
one CPU, no matter how many are available. Multithreading on a multi-CPU
machine increases concurrency.</li>
