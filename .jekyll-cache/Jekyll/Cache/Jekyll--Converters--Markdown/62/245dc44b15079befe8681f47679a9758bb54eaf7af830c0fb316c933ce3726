<p>It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring. In this chapter we
 shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial
 rings. We can prove prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to
 the theorems we proved for the integers.  Analogs of prime numbers, the divsion
 algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.</p>
