<p>On objects, a bifunctor maps every pair of objects, one from category $\mathbf{C}$,
and one from category $\mathbf{D}$, to an object in category $\mathbf{E}$.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This is just saying that itâ€™s a mapping from a Cartesian product of categories
$\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{D}$ to $\mathbf{E}$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functoriality means that a bifunctor has to map morphisms as well. This time,
it must map a pair of morphisms, one from $\mathbf{C}$ and one from $\mathbf{D}$, to a morphism in $\mathbf{E}$</p>
  </li>
</ul>
