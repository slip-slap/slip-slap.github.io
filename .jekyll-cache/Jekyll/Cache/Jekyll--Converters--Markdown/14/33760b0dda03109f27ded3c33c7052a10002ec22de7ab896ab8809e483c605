<h4 id="remark">Remark</h4>
<p>For some very common words, such as <em>can, my,the, to, be, some, me</em>, I am not awared
my problem in pronounciation. My pronounciation is abrupt, lack of rhythm, since
I canâ€™t pronounce this trivial words correctly.</p>

<p>The focus of American pronounciation is in the vowel sound, so the consonant
sound is not important. You can hear the say the consotant sound in a lazy way.
For example, the Korean player <em>showmaker</em>, you should focus on the vowel part,
igore the constoant part, you will be understood well.</p>

<p>To pronounce correctly, it need the teamwork of your mouth, throat, and the
belly.</p>
