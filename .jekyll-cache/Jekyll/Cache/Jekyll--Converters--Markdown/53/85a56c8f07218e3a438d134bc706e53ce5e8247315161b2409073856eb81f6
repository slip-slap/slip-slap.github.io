      <li>this is a simple word, but for the moment I just realize how to pronounce it.
the alphabet â€œxâ€ has two sounds â€œkâ€ and â€œsâ€. â€œkâ€ should be read out in a light
voice, but â€œxâ€ should be amphasised.</li>

  <li>maybe the most important thing for pronounciation is find out where to
emphasis.</li>
  <li>â€œA,E,I,O,Uâ€ and the rest of the alphabet play diffent roles. The former is
used to pronounce, the rest is for express the meaning of the word.</li>
  <li>I know how to pronounce a word correctly, but as for a sentence, most time I
donâ€™t pronounce correctly.  Last time, I was watching friends, a female
character whose name is Julia, the way she spoke new york impressed me a lot.
and for a long time, japanse words that are from english confused me a lot,
but today, I realized the difference.</li>
  <li>Another scene made an impression on me is the scene a girl call Chandler and
leave a phone message, it was a very long sentence, but if you focus on where
should you emphasis, it will not be a problem.</li>
