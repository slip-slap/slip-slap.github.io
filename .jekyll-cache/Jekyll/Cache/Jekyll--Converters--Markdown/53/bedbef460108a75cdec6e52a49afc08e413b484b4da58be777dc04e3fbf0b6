<ol>
  <li>The Euclidean space $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ is the prototype of all manifolds. Not
only is it the simplest, but locally every manifold looks like$ \mathbb{R}^{n} $.</li>
  <li>A good understanding of $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ is essential in generalizing
differential and integral calculus to a manifold.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="drawback-and-benefits">Drawback and Benefits</h4>
<p>Euclidean space is special in having a set of standard global coordinates</p>
<ol>
  <li>Blessing: all construction on  $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ can be defined in terms of
the standard coordinates and all computations carried out explicitly</li>
  <li>Handicap: defined in terms of coordinates, it is often not obvious which
concepts are intrinsic, i.e., independent of coordinates</li>
  <li>Since a manifold in general does not have standard coordinates, only
coordinate-independent concepts will make sense on a manifold.</li>
</ol>
