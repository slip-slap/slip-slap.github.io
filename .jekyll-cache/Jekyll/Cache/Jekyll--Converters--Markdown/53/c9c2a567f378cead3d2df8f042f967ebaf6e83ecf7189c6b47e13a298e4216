<h4 id="finite-extensive-form">Finite Extensive Form</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A finite exensive form(or frame) with perfect information consists of the following items.
    <ul>
      <li>A finite rooted directed tree.</li>
      <li>A set of players $I = {1,\cdots, n}$ and a function that assigns one player to every decision
node.</li>
      <li>A set of actions A and a function that assigns one action to every directed edge, satisfying the
restriction that no two edges out of the same node are assigned the same action.</li>
      <li>A set of outcomes $O$ and a function that assigns an outcome to every terminal node.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finite Extensive Game with Perfect Information
A Finite extensive game with perfect information is a finite extensive form with perfect information
together with a ranking $ \succsim i $ of the set of outcomes $O$, for every player $i \in I$.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="backward-induction">Backward Induction</h4>
<p>The backward-induction algorithm is the following procedure for solving a finite perfect-information
game:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a decision node x whose immediate successors are all marked. Let $i$ be the player who
moves at $x$, Select a choice that leads to an immediate successor of x with the highest
payoff(or utility) for Player i(highest among the utilities associated with the immediate
successors of x). mark x with the payoff vector associated with the node that follows the
selected choice.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above step until all the nodes have been marked.</li>
</ol>
