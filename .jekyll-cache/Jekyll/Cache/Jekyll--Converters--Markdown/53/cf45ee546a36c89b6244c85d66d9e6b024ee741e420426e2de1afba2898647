<p>modular arithmetic: modular arithmetic can be handled mathematically by introducing a congruence relation
on the integers that is compatible with the operations on integers: addition, subtraction, and muliplication</p>

<h4 id="polynomial-arithmetic-in-field-prime11">Polynomial arithmetic in Field (prime=11)</h4>
<p>Example:
\(q=\alpha^{k}\)
and, <br />
\(q(\alpha + \beta) = (\alpha + \beta)^{k}\)</p>

<p>if k=p <br />
\(q(\alpha) = \beta^{p}+(\alpha - \beta)^p\)</p>
