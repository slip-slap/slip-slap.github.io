  <li>We saw that arclenght measures how far a curve is from being stationary.</li>
  <li>Our preliminary concept of curvature is that it should measure how far a
curve is from being a line.</li>

  <li>For a planar curve the idea used to be to find a circle that best
approximates the curve at a point(just like a tangent line is the line that
best approximates the curve)</li>
  <li>The radius of this circle then gives a measure of how the curve bends with
larger radius implying less bending.</li>
  <li>Huygens did quite a lot to clarify this idea for fairly general curves using
purely geometric considerations(no calculus) and applied it to the study
involutes and evolutes.</li>
