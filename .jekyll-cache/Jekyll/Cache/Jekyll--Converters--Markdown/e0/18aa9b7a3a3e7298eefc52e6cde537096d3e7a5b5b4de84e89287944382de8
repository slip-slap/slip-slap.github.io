<h4 id="conversation-with-japanese-high-school-students-20190622">Conversation with Japanese High School Students 2019.06.22</h4>
<p>Two weeks ago, I was invited to joined this activity, I should say no, but I
didnâ€™t. I should follow my heart. <br /></p>

<p>I draw everything, she draw sculpture, animal, I just like drawingâ€. I like her
personality.  I donâ€™t know how to say this kind of personity in english.  In
Chinese, it kind of æ•£æ¼«ï¼Œæ´’è„±ï¼Œä¸ç”©. just pay attention to what you like, you
like it, and you learn. why you need a purpose. For living to learn, Itâ€™s
pathethic. She comes to Japan just to learn Japanese. Thatâ€™s cool.   <br /></p>

<p>I was impressed by Japanese students. A high school girl told me her dream is go
to Belgium. I even donâ€™t know where is Belgium. She wants to go there.  Because
she likes cholocate there. When I was in high school, I never stepped out of my
city. She has went to so many place. I am jealous. <br /></p>

<p>I said I was so old, because I am twenty seven years old. She said: â€œeveryone
used to be a babyâ€.</p>

<h4 id="é³¥è²´æ—ã§">é³¥è²´æ—ã§</h4>
<p>We went to torikizoku to have barbecue. Itâ€™s a very noisy place, people there
yelling, talking, and laughing. we ordered food by a tablet. The food was not
too bad. During the food time, I think people sometimes are selfish, they just
ordered food they like, they donâ€™t care the others opinoin. You should ask the
othersâ€™ opinoin because we pay together. I went to the cashier, and give the
waiter 20,000å††. He was supposed to give 3,306å†† back to me. But at that time I
was in a hurry, so I just took the 306å††, and I didâ€™t realize that at that time.
After all my friend gived the money that they should pay. I found there is
something wrong with my money. So I went back to the restaurant. I didâ€™t expect
to get the money back, I just treated this as an opportunity to practice
Japanese. And what surprised to me is they just ask me to show the receipt to
them, and give me the money that I forgot. If you are in China, and you
encountered this case, most possible, you canâ€™t get your money back. Maybe you
can get your money back, you just need spend a lot of time and energy.</p>

<h4 id="be-a-volunter-in-g20-meeting-20190627-29">Be a volunter in G20 meeting 2019.06.27-29</h4>
<p>Asked by the Chinese Scholarship Council, I joined the G20 summit as a volunter.
I was so excited, maybe I can see some Chinese president. American President
Donald Trump,Germany President Merkel. I hoped. But nothing. There are people
who come from Hongkong, Taiwan, Xinjiang. These people want their place to be
independent of China. So they want to rush into the street and the stop the
president car. And our job is to find them and stop them. And you know the
president cars run very quickly about 70 kilometers an hour. and my
responsibility is make sure when the cars drove by me is safe. And the funny
thing is because itâ€™s a very important meething. I think all of japanese cops
came to Japan, and there are also so many plain clothes police.  At the
crossroads where I stand, there are seven policeman and one plain clothes
police. Because my job is stand there. and I am so worried, I think I was the
most suspicious terrorist. I was so afraid.</p>
