<h4 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h4>
<p>Lieâ€™s original motivation was to study the group of transformations of a space
as a continuous analogue of the group of permutations of a finite set.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indeed, a diffeomorphism of a manifold M can be viewed as a permutation of the
points of M.</li>
  <li>The Interplay of group theory of group theory, topology, and linear algebra
makes the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras a particularly rich and
vibrant branch of mathematics.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="application">Application</h4>
<p>In manifold theory, Lie groups serve mainly as an importatn class of manifolds,
and Lie algebras as examples of tangent spaces.</p>
