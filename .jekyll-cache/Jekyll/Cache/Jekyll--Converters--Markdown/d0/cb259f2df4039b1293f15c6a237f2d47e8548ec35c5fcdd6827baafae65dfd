  <li>Directed Graph D: a directed graph D is an ordered triple $(V(D),A(D),\psi_D)$ consisting of 
a nonempty set $V(D)$ of vertices, a set $A(D)$, disjoint from $V(D)$, or arcs,
and an incidence function $\psi_D$ that associates with each arc of D an ordered
pair of vertices of D.
    <ul>
      <li>if a is an arc and u van v are vertices such that $\psi_D (a)=(u,v)$, then a
is said to join u to v;</li>
      <li>u is the tail of a, and v is its head.</li>
      <li>For convenience, â€˜directed graphâ€™ is abbreviated to <strong>digraph</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Directed Walk: A directed walk in D is a finite non-null sequence
$W=(v_0,a_1,v_1,\cdots,a_k,v_k)$, whose terms are alternately vertices and
arcs,</li>
  <li>Directed Trail: a directed trail is a directed walk that is a trail.</li>
  <li>Indegree: the indegree \(d_{\mathrm{D}}^{-}(v)\) of a vertex v in D is the number of arcs with head v</li>
  <li>Outdegree: the outdegree \(d_{\mathrm{D}}^{+}(v)\) of v is the number of arcs with tail v
    <ul>
      <li>denote the minimum and minimum and maximum indegrees and outdegrees in D by
$\delta^{-} (D), \Delta^{-} (D)$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Reachable: If there is a directed $(u,v)-path$ in D, vertex $v$ is said to be
reachable from vertex $u$ in D.</li>
  <li>Diconnected: Two vertices are diconnected in D if each is reachable from the
other.</li>
  <li>Strict: A digraph is strict if it has no loops and no two arcs with the same
ends have the same orientation.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="theorem">Theorem</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A digraph $D$ contains a directed path of length $\chi-1$</li>
