<ol>
  <li>N - natural numbers</li>
  <li>Z - integer   Z was used to denote integers because a germany mathmatician  did a great job on ring theory. In germany language, integers are Zahlen.</li>
  <li>Q - rational numbers (from quotient)</li>
  <li>R - real numbers</li>
  <li>C - complex numbers</li>
</ol>

<p>At first, there is only positive number and zero in the world, because they make sense. Natural numbes are closed 
and operations of addition and multiplification. <br />
After minus operation was created, Natural numbers  is not closed any more. So negative numbers were invented.
Numbers are extend from natural numbers to integer<br />
After divide operation was created, Integer is not closed any more. So rational numbers were invented.
Numbers are extend from integer to rational numbers. <br />
Because the first math crisis,  \(\sqrt{2}\) comes out, in order to deal with these numbers. So irrational numbers were invented.
Numbers are extend from ration numbers to real numbers. <br />
At last, we run into complex numbers, so what does \(2^i\) mean, how to calulate this crap ? <br />
we can use Taylor expansion to calculate. <br /> 
complex numbers is very useful to calculate integral problem.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>i</strong> is not a number, which means rotation 90 degree.</li>
  <li><strong>1+i</strong> stands for the rotate state</li>
  <li>The complex numbers allow us to consider scalings and rotations as two instances of the same thing;
and by ensuring that negative reals have square roots, we get something every ploynominal equation can be 
solved: <strong>complex number is the algebraic closure of R</strong></li>

<p>\(y^{3}=p y+q\) <br />
solution: <br />
\(y^{3}=\sqrt{\frac{q}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^{3}}}+
\sqrt[3]{\frac{q}{2}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^{3}}}\)</p>

<p>Example: <br />
\(x^3=15x+4\)
solution: <br />
\(x=\sqrt[3]{2+11 \sqrt{-1}}+\sqrt[3]{2-11 \sqrt{-1}}\)</p>

<p>\(\begin{array}{l}{(2+i)^{3}=2+11 i} \\ {(2-i)^{3}=2-11 i}\end{array}\)
<br />
\(x=2+i+2-i=4\)</p>
