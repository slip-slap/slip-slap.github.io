<p>One bit of computer memory is made of only four NAND gates.
| a | b | c |
|—|—|—|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |</p>

  <li>When gates are used for something like this, the name “gate” starts to make some sense.</li>
  <li>An enabler allows a byte through when the bit ‘e’ is 1 and stops the byte when it is 0.</li>
  <li>So ‘e’ being on is like opening a gate, and ‘e’ being off is like closing a gate.</li>
  <li>There will be a few places where there are registers that never need to have their outputs turned
off. In those cases, we will draw a register that only has a ‘set’ bit, and no ‘enable’ bit, we
should probably refer to these devices as bytes, but we will call them registers nonetheless.</li>
