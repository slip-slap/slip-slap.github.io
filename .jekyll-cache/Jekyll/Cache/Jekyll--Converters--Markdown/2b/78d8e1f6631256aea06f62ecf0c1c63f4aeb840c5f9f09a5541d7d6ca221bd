<p>We already know that the converse of Lagrangeâ€™s Theorem is false. If G is a
group of order m and n divides m, then G does not necessarily possess a subgroup
or order n.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, $A_4$ has order 12 but does not possess a subgroup of order 6.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sylows-theorem">Sylowâ€™s Theorem</h4>
<p>Let $(G,*)$ be a finite group such that $p^n$ divides $|G|$, where p is prime.
Then there exists a subgroup of order $p^n$.</p>
