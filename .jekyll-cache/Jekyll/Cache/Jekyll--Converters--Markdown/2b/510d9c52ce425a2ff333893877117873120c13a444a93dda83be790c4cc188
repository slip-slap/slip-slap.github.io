  <li>Independent set: A subset S of V is called an independent set of G if no two
vertices of S are adjacent in G.</li>
  <li>Clique: A clique of a simple graph G is a subset S of V such that G[S] is
complete
    <ul>
      <li>This name <strong>Clique</strong> is very intuitive and informative, in a clique, everyone knows each
other, in a graph, every vertice is connected to the other vertices in the
clique.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Why we have the concept such as “Independent set” and “Clique”, because they
are the basic building blocks of a graph, just as the concept in the other
subject.</li>
