<p>CMake is a string-oriented language.
CMake is a string-oriented language.
CMake is a string-oriented language.</p>
<ul>
  <li>After you understand this, everything will be very clear.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="organization">Organization</h4>
<ol>
  <li>CMake input files are written in the ‚ÄúCMake Language‚Äù in source files named
<strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong> or ending in a <strong>.cmake</strong> file name extension. CMake
Language source files in a project are organized into:
    <ul>
      <li>Directories</li>
      <li>Scripts</li>
      <li>Modules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="cmake">CMake</h4>
<ol>
  <li>You must treat Cmake as a programming language with <strong>special syntax</strong>, how
to treat cmake as a programming language, things you need keep in mind
    <ul>
      <li>treat every statement with parenthesis as a function, figure out the function
mean and related parameters</li>
      <li>it‚Äôs a special language, because it has predefined variable, you need pay
attention.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Compared with maven, all the required library is in local, it doesn‚Äôt have
default catagory structure.</li>
  <li>Both of them need configuration file, maven need ‚Äúpom.xml‚Äù, cmake needs
‚ÄúCMakeLists.txt‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="with-make">With Make</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Make is designed to debug c language, but it‚Äôs not easy to use.</li>
  <li>So cmake comes out, the code you write in CMakeLists.txt would be translated
to Makefile.</li>
  <li>for example <strong>add_executable(Tutorial tutorial.cxx)</strong> in CMakeLists,
actually will be translated into corresponding make language, such as
compile, link etc.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>At first, I think cmake is easy, I don‚Äôt take it as a programming language.</li>
  <li>Second, I take cmake too complicate.</li>
  <li>Finaly, cmake is just a programming language, it follows most programming language patterns.
    <ul>
      <li>you define a variable in another cmake script, you load it, then you can use this veriable.</li>
      <li>you define a function, also know as, a command, you load it, then you can call it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
