<p>Mathematicians are lazy, much like programmers are lazy. They want to abstract
everything so that a statement can be made to apply to as many things as

that abstracts away characteristics of many different classes. So we can have
Fruit, Apple, and Orange with Fruit being the base. <br /> definition:
Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is

<p>sup: short for supremum, the supremum of a subset S of a partially ordered set T
is the least element in T that is greater than or equal to all elements of S, if
such an element exists.  inf: short for infimum, the infimum of a subset of a
partially ordered set T is the greatest element in T that is less than or equal
to all elements of S, if such an element exists.</p>
