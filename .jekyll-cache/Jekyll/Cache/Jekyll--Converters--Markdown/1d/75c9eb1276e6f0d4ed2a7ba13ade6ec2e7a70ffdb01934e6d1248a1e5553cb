<p>Get out of hand - This thing completely make sense if you interprate it in this
way, where <em>get</em> is a verb, and <em>out of hand</em> means out of control. This is
pretty common, examples are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Come on: <em>on</em> means something happens.</li>
  <li>take into accound: <em>into account</em></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pattern-2-move-around-a-sentence">Pattern 2: Move around a sentence</h4>
<p>Pick up the part that you think is important, and place it at the begining of a
sentence. It could be anything, such as the subject, object, even a verb. For
example,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Here it is: we want to focus on the place <em>here</em>, so we place it at the
beginning.
It is weired to me when the first time I learned it from my english teacher in
junior school.</li>
</ul>
