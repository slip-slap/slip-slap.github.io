<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In mathematics, a bivector or 2-vector is a quantity in exterior algebra or
geometric algebra that extends the idea of scalars and vectors.If scalar is
considered an order zero quanity, and a vector is an order of one quantity,
then a bivector can be thought of as being of order two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Vector $\vec{a}$ is a directed line segment.</li>
  <li>Bi-vector:
$
\vec{a} \vee \vec{b}
$ is a directed plane segment.</li>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Affine plane: an affine plane is a two-dimensional space, an affine space
   is a geometric structure that generalizes some of the properties of
   Euclidean spaces in such a way that these are independent of the concepts
   of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to
   parallelism.
2. Euclidean planes is an affine plane over the reals, equipped with a
   metric, the Euclidean distance.  In other words, an affine plane over the
   reals in a Euclidean plane in which one has forgotten the metric.
3. For every field or divison ring F is also an affine plane.
