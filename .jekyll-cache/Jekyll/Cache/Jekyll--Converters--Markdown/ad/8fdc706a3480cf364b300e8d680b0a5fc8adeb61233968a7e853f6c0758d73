  <li>f(x,y) = (u,v) where u = u(x,y) and v = v(x,y)</li>
  <li>f(z) = w where z and w are complex numbers
Whatâ€™s the difference between the equations above ? No difference at all.
We can do conformal mapping with complex number ?
    <ul>
      <li>The reason we need this because comlex numbers give us some advantage when we
do comformal mapping.</li>
      <li>Conformal mappling doesnâ€™t belong to complex number, just based on the
properties of complex number, we can do conformal mapping better.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>conformal: leaving the size of the angle between corresponding curves
unchanged &lt;conformal transformation&gt;</li>
