<p>Typefaces can be divided into three cateogories: serif, sans serif, monospaced.</p>

<h4 id="11-serif">1.1 Serif</h4>
<p>Serif is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger
stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font of family of fonts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the Chinese and Japanese writing systems, there are common type styles
  based on the regular script for Chinese characters akin to serif and sans
  serif.</li>
  <li>In Mainland China, the most popular category of serifed-like typefaces is
called Song(宋体); Black(黑体) is sans serif-like.</li>
  <li>Times New Roman is a serif typeface.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="12-sans-serif">1.2 Sans serif</h4>
<p>Sans serif is one that does not have extending features called “serif” at the
end of strokes. Sans-serif fonts tend to have less stroke width variation than
serif fonts. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or
minimalism.</p>

<h4 id="13-monospaced">1.3 Monospaced</h4>
<p>Monospaced type is the one that its letters and characters each occupy the same
amount of horizontal space. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the
letters and spacings have different widths.</p>

<h3 id="2-italic-roman-and-blackletter">2 Italic, roman, and blackletter</h3>
<p>When used as adjectives, italic means designed to resemble a handwriting style
developed in Italy in the 16th century. Whereas roman means upright, as opposed
to italic.</p>

<ul>
  <li>roman literally means nonitalic, which is not slant.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-fonts-for-mathematics">3. Fonts for mathematics</h3>
<p>In general, anything that represents a variable should be set in italic type, and anything else shoud be set in roman type.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This applies equally to characters from the Lation/English alphabet as to letters from any other alphabet.</li>
  <li>Any operator, such as cos should be set roman.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Blackboard bold is a typeface style that is often used for certain symbols
in mathematical texts, in which certain lines of the symbol(usually
vertical or near-vertical lines) are doubled.
    <ul>
      <li>The symbols usually denote number sets, such as \(\mathbb{R}\)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
