<h4 id="for-example-and-for-instance">for example and for instance</h4>
<p>There is very little difference between <em>for example</em> and <em>for instance</em>. They
have the same or nearly the same meaning, and they are used in the same way.</p>
<ul>
  <li>However, that <em>for example</em> is used much more frequently than <em>for instance</em>,
particularly in formal contexts, so in academic writing it is a safer choice.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Poor balance is a problem for a lot of older people, like my grandmother,
for instance.</li>
  <li>Mobile devices are becoming less expensive. Sophisticated smartphones, for
instance, can now be purchased for less than $100.</li>
</ol>
