<h4 id="pages-and-posts">Pages and posts</h4>
<p>Pages and posts are just two types of written content thatâ€™s styled differently.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pages are content(like an â€œAboutâ€ page) that isnâ€™t organized or displayed
chronologically, but might be included in your websiteâ€™s main menu.</li>
  <li>Posts are meant to be used for content best organized by publication date.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>The URLs for pages and posts are also different by default.
    <ul>
      <li>Page URLs look like <em>MySite.com/about/</em>, while post URLs look like
<em>MySite.com/2016/02/29/my-post-title.html.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
