  <li>A network N is a digraph D with two distinguished subsets of vertices, X and
Y, and a non-negative integer-valued function c defined on its arc set A; the
sets X and Y are assumed to be disjoint and nonempty.
    <ul>
      <li>X and Y correspond to production centres and markets</li>
      <li>vertices which are neither sources nor sinks are called <strong>Intermediate
Vertices</strong>, the set of such vertices will be denoted by I.</li>
      <li>Capacity Function: the function c is the capacity function of N and its value
on an arc a the capacity of a.</li>
      <li>The capacity of an arc can be thought of as representing the maximum rate at
which a commodity can be transported along it.</li>
    </ul>
