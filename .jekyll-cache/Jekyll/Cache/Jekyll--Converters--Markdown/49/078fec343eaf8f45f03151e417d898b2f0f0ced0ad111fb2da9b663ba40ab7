<h4 id="spanning-sets">Spanning Sets</h4>
<p>A set of vector \(\left\{\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \dots, \vec{v}_{n}\right\}\) is a spanning set for <br />
$\mathcal{A^3} \leftrightarrow$ for every vector $\vec{v} \in \mathcal{A^3}$ 
can be written as: <br />
\(\vec{v}=a_{1} \vec{v}_{1}+a_{2} \vec{v}_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} \vec{v}_{n}\)</p>

<h4 id="linear-independent-sets">Linear Independent Sets</h4>
<p>a set of vectors 
\(\left\{\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \dots, \vec{v}_{n}\right\}\)
in $\mathcal{A^3}$ is linearly independent
$\leftrightarrow$ none of the vectors can be written as linear combination of
the others.</p>

  <li>The origin of linear algebra is affine geometry. Because of affine geometry,
we found linear algebra. After that, linear algebra is be treated as a
independent branch.</li>
  <li>Linear algebra is just a tool for computation, <strong>It can used to deal with so
many problems, just as a tool to calculation, donâ€™t be afraid</strong>.</li>
  <li>We are so familiar with the computation of addition, minus,
multiplication,division, but not too familiar with calculus, derivative,
least familiar with matrix compuation. **As a mathematican, we shoud not
afraid any calculation of math **</li>
