<ol>
  <li>It origins from logic theory, logical connection
    <ul>
      <li>The slogan of Saunders Mac Laneâ€™s book is <strong>Adjont functors arise everywhere</strong></li>
      <li>Adjunctions provide a more general language to describe a lot of
constructions weâ€™ve studied before.</li>
      <li>Understanding adjointness gives you a valuable addition to your mathematical
toolkit. Most professional pure mathematicians know what categories and
functos are, but far fewer know about adjoints. More should: adjoint functors
are both common and easy, and knowing about adjoints helps you to spot
patterns in the mathematical landscape.</li>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>

<p>$ F: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{B} $ and $ G: \mathscr{B} \rightarrow
\mathscr{A} $</p>
<ul>
  <li>F is said to be left adjoint to G.</li>
  <li>G is said to right adjoint to F.</li>
</ul>
