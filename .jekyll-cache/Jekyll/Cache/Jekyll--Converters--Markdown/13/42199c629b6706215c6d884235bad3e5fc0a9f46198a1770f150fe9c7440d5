<h4 id="remark-operation-on-tensor-fields">Remark: Operation on tensor fields</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Suppose T is a (p,q) tensor field, S is a (r,s) tensor field.</li>
  <li>The \(T\bigotimes S\) operation means tensor product.</li>
  <li>
\[T\bigotimes S (\omega,\cdots,x,\cdots) = T(\omega,\cdots,x,\cdots) \cdot S(\cdots,\cdots)\]
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>Let S be an n-dimensional manifold. If S is an open subset of \(R^{n}\), then by defining the tangent vector of a curve \(\gamma\),
tangent space \(T_{p}M\), at each point may be considered equivalent to \(R^{n}\). This means that for p and q not equal, there is
still a natural correspondence between \(T_{p}M \text { and } T_{q}M\). Hence to consider relationships between \(T_{p}M \text {and} T_{q}M\), we must
somehow augment the structure of S as a manifold. <strong>Affine Connections</strong> are such a structural augemtation.</p>

  <li><strong>Affine Connections</strong> also named as <strong>linear connection</strong>, <strong>covariant derivative</strong>.</li>
  <li>\(\nabla_{X}\) is the extension of X.</li>

<h4 id="definition-connection">Definition: Connection</h4>
<p>A connection \(\nabla\) on a smooth manifold \((M,O,\mathscr{A})\) is a map takes a pair of consisting of 
a vector(field) X and a (p,q)-tensor field T and sends them to a (p,q)-tensor field\(\nabla_{X}^{T}\).  <br />
A manifold with connection is a quadruple of structure \((M,O,\mathscr{A},\nabla)\)</p>

<h4 id="terminology-1-connection-coefficients">Terminology 1: connection coefficients</h4>
<p>Connections coefficients of the affine connection with respect to the coordiante system \([\xi^{i}]\)</p>

  <li>How does <em>covariant</em> work with derivative?
    <ul>
      <li>The term <em>covariant</em> usually refers to Riemannâ€™s requirement that this
derivative be independent of the choice of local coordinates, and hence
change covariantly with respect to changes in coordinates.</li>
      <li>In nature, it is derivative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Covariant derivative derives from directional derivative.
    <ul>
      <li>
\[\nabla_{\vec{w}} \vec{v}\]
      </li>
      <li>where $\vec{v}$ replaces a function, which extend the space form one-dimensional to n-dimensional.</li>
      <li>The direction vector $\vec{w}$ still refers to the direction vector.</li>
      <li>In nature, this is a differentiable expression, so whatâ€™s the domain?</li>
      <li>The domain here is not vector $\vec{w}$, it is the point along some curve on the mainfold.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If we think of \(\nabla_{\vec{w}} \vec{v}\) as a representation of covariant derivative on a manifold.
    <ul>
      <li>$\vec{v}$ refers to a line on the manifold.</li>
      <li>$\vec{w}$ refers to the vector field.
\(\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial u^{i}}}(\vec{v})=
\left(\frac{\partial v^{k}}{\partial u^{i}}+v^{j} \Gamma_{i j}^{k}\right) \overrightarrow{e_{k}}\)</li>
      <li>here $\frac{\partial}{\partial u^{i}}$ refers to the basis vector of tangent line at some point along a curve.</li>
      <li>$\vec{e_k}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial u^{i}}$ are at the same tangent plane at the same point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
