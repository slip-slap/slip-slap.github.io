  <li>We can characterize equality of differences using only the concept of addition
    <ul>
      <li>so we will take advantage of our foreknowledge by building all this into the
definition of the integers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we will temporarily write integers not as a difference $a-b$, but instead use
a new notation $aâ€“b$ to define integers
    <ul>
      <li>$â€“$ is a meaningless place-holder, similar to the comma in the Cartesian
co-ordinate notation $(x,y)$ for points in the plane.</li>
      <li>Later when we define substraction we will see that $aâ€“b$ is in fact equal to
$a-b$, and so we can discard the notation $â€“$</li>
      <li>These devices are similar to the scaffolding used to construct a building;
they are temporarily essential to make sure the building is build correctly,
but onc the building is completed they are thrown away and never used again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
