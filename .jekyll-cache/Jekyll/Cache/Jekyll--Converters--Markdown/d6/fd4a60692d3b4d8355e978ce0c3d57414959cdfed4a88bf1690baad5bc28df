  <li>In 2-dimensional plane coordinate, we have distance concept, which is very eazy to understand.</li>
  <li>According to this concept, we can define continuity <br />
\(\left|x-x_{0}\right|&lt;\delta \Rightarrow\left|f(x)-f\left(x_{0}\right)\right|&lt;\varepsilon\)
This rule can be applied to n-dimensional space, so we can define open ball</li>
  <li>we abstract the open ball concept as open set</li>
  <li>open set can be further abstracted to topology concept</li>
  <li>So mapping from open set to open set is the core of math, and now we can discard the initial distance concept.</li>
