<p>Recall the definition of Riemann Integral</p>

\[\(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x \equiv \lim _{\max \Delta x_{k} \rightarrow 0}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} f\left(x_{k}^{*}\right) \Delta x_{k}\)\]

<ul>
  <li>Can we just replace the variable with complex number?</li>
  <li>of course we can.</li>
  <li>after the lower bound and upper bound are replaced by complex number,
something very weired comes out.</li>
  <li>There are numberous integral path from complex number $a$ to complex number $b$,
how to deal with this.</li>
  <li>very simple, choose one path.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cauchy-goursat-theorem">Cauchy-Goursat Theorem</h4>
<p>This theorem states if a function is analytic at all points interior to and on a
simple contour C, then the value of the integral of the function around that
contour is zero.</p>
