<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>In mathematics, a presentation is one method of specifying a group. A
presentation of a group G comprises a set S of generators-so that every element
of the group can be written as a product of some of these generators-and a set R
of relations among those generators. We can say G has presentation. <br />
$
\langle S | R\rangle
$ <br /></p>

<p>As a simple example, the cyclic group of order n has the presentation <br />
$
\langle a | a^n=1 \rangle
$</p>
