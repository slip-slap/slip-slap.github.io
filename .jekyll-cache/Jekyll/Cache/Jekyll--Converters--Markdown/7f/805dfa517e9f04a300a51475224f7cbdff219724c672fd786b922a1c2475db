  <li>The earth is round, this may at one point have been hard to believe, but we
have grown accusomed to it even though our everyday experience is that the
earth is (fairly flat)</li>
  <li>The most effective way to illustrate it  is by maps: a globe is a very neat
device, but its global character makes it less than practical if you want to
represent fine details.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Locally you can represent things by means of ‚Äúcharts‚Äù, but the global
character can‚Äôt be represented by one single chart. You need an entire atlas,
and you need to know how the charts are to be assembled, or even better: the
charts overlap so that we know how they all fit together</li>
  <li>The mathematical framework for working with such situations is manifold
theory</li>
</ol>

  <li>A manifold is a generalization of curves and surfaces to higher dimensions</li>
