  <li>The theory of convex optimization is far more straighforward than the theory
of general nonlinear optimization.</li>
  <li>Using a local optimization method is more tricker than solving a
least-square problem, linear program, or convex optimization problem.</li>
  <li>It has been recognized that the theory of convex optimization is far more
straightforward than the theory of general nonlinear optimization.</li>
