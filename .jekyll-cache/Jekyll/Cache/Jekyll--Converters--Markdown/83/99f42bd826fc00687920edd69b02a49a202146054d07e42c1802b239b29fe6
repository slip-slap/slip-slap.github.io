<p>Grossberg networks are so heavily influenced by biology that it is difficult to
discuss his networks without putting them in their biological context. It is
also important to note that biology provided the orginal inspiratons for the
field of artificial neural networks.</p>

  <li>In the figure, we have a schematic representation of the first stages of the
visual system, much of what we will see is not actually present in the image
projected onto retina.</li>

<p>Alough the original inspiration for the field of artificial neural networks came
from biology, at times we forget to look back to biology for new ideas. <strong>It
will be the blending of biology, mathemtatics, psychology and other disciplines
that will provide the maximum growth in our understanding of neural networks.</strong></p>
