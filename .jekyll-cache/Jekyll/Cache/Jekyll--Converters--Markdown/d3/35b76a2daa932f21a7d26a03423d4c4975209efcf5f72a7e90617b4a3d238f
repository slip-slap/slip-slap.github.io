<p>Polynomial functions are important because they are simple, easy to compute and
approximate any continuous functions on an interval.</p>

<h4 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h4>
<p>Find a polynomial $p(x)$ of lowest degree passing through n points<br />
$A_1 [X_1,Y_1],A_2 [X_2,Y_2],A_n [X_n,Y_n],$ <br />
We expect the degree of $p(x)$ is n-1</p>
