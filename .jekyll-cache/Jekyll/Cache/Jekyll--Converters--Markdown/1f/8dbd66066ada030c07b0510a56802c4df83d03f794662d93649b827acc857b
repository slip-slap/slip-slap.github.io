<p>The main question is: when faced with a problem, do we always have the choice
between a declarative and imperative approaches to solving it?</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there is a declarative solution, can it always be translated into computer
code?</li>
  <li>The answer to this question is far from obvious and, if we could find it, we
would probably revolutinonize our understanding of universe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Richard Feynman mentions this duality as an inspiration in his own work on
quantum electrodynamics.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are two forms of expressing most laws of physics. One used local,or
infinitesimal, considerations.</li>
  <li>We look at the state of a system around a small neighborhood, and predict how
it will evolve within the next instant of time.</li>
  <li>This is usually expressed using differential equations that have to be
integrated, or summed up. over a period of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>The other approach is global.</p>
