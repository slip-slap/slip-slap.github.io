based on the regular script for Chinese characters akin to serif and sans
serif.</li>
  <li>In Mainland China, the most popular category of serifed-like typefaces is called Song(ÂÆã‰Ωì); Black(Èªë‰Ωì) is sans serif-like.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Sans serif is one that does not have extending features called ‚Äúserif‚Äù at
the end of strokes. Sans-serif fonts tend to have less stroke width
