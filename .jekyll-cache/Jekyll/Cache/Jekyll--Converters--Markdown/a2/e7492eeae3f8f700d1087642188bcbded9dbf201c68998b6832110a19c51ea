<ol>
  <li>laminate is only subject to in-plane loading and it is symmetric, curvature
terms become zero.</li>
  <li>for the same reason, the mechanical response of the laminate is independent
of the stacking sequence.</li>

<ol>
  <li>The validity and applicability of a given failure criterion depend on the
convenience of application and agreement with reliable experimental data.</li>
