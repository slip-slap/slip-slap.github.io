<h4 id="1-include_directories-and-target_include_directories">1. include_directories and target_include_directories</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>include_directories(x/y): affects directory scope. All targets in this
CMakeList, as well as those in all subdirectores add after the point of its
call, will have the path x/y added to their include path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>target_include_directories(target_name x/y): adds x/y to the include path for target.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>You want the former one if all of your targets use the include directories in question. You want the 
latter one if the path is specific to a target.</li>
  <li>if you want finer control of the pathâ€™s visibility. The latter comes from the
fact that target_include_directores() support the PRIVATE, PUBLIC, and INTERFACE qualifiers.</li>
</ul>
