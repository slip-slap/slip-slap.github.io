  <li>A k-vertex colouring of G is an assignment of k colours, $1,2,\cdots,k$ to
the vertices of G;
    <ul>
      <li>The colouring is proper if no two distince adjacent vertices have the same
colour.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>chromatic number: \(\chi(G)\), of G is the minimum k for which G is
k-colourable;
    <ul>
      <li>if \(\chi(G)=k\), G is said to be k-chromatic.

  <li>Girth: the girth of G is the length of a shortest cycle in G; if G has no
cycles we define the girth of G to be infinite.</li>
