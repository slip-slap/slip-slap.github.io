<p>In most object-oriented code, different objects must deal with one another in
some fashion. What then happens when a particular object needs to be changed?
As with responsibility changes, this poses a challenge for the maintenance of
downstream objects that could inadvertently be affected by the change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One way to reduce the impact of this challenge is to adhere to the second of
the SOLID principles: the Open-Closed Principle</li>
</ul>

  <li>open for extension, but closed for modification
    <ul>
      <li>you can always add new code to an object, but should never change the design
of old code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
