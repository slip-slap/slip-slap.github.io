<h4 id="question-1-what-is-a-linear-map-">Question 1: what is a linear map ?</h4>
<p>A linear map is from a <strong>vector space</strong> to another <strong>vector space</strong></p>

<h4 id="question-2-how-to-define-a-point-p-on-a-manifold-">Question 2: How to define a point p on a manifold ?</h4>
<p>define \((M,O,\mathscr{A})\) is a smooth manifold <br />
curve \(\gamma: R \rightarrow M\) is at least \(C^{1}\) <br />
suppose \(\gamma(\lambda_{o})=p\)</p>

<h4 id="question-3--what-is-the-velocity-of-a-curve-alpha-at-point-p-">Question 3:  what is the velocity of a curve \(\alpha\) at point p ?</h4>
<p>Based on question 2, we define a point on a manifold, and now we can define the velocity.
The velocity of curve \(\alpha\) at point p is the linear map. <br />
\(V_{r,p}: C^{\infty}(M) \rightarrow R\) <br />
Where V stands for velocity, r stands for curve, p stands for a point on curve.
\(C^{\infty}\) stands for continuous, M stands for deferential manifold. <br />
\(C^{\infty}(M)\): stand for a vector space: \({f: M \rightarrow R| f means smooth function}\), equipped with the following structure <br /> 
\((f\bigoplus g)_{p}\):= f(p)+g(p) <br /> 
\((\lambda\bigodot g)_{p}:= \lambda \cdot g(p)\) <br /> 
R is also a vector space, itâ€™s pretty simple.</p>

<h4 id="remark">remark</h4>
<p>The intuition which is very helpful, this is actually children uncorrupted by high school physics capture
the concept of velocity.Because it as the following: <br />
you run around the world as a child, and you observe the world around you, say the world around you, there are
some temperature function,</p>

<h5 id="tangent-vector-space">Tangent Vector Space</h5>
<p>Def: For each point \(p \in M\), we define the set <br /> 
\(T_{p}M :={v_{r,p}| r smooth curve}\) <br />
which means tangent sapce to M at point P. <br /></p>
<h4 id="observation">observation</h4>
<p>\(T_{p}M\) can be made into a vector space</p>

<h4 id="component-of-a-vector-respect-to-a-chart">Component of a Vector respect to a chart</h4>

<h4 id="remark-1">Remark 1:</h4>
<p>Since a partial derivative is simply a directional derivation along a cooridnate axis.</p>

<h4 id="remark-2">Remark 2:</h4>
<p>I have learn Riemann geometry for about one week. Something suddenly come to  mind, mathematician is the most clever guy in the world.</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, so called operation, such as addition, multiplification has to depend on space, Itâ€™s just a map from a space to another space.</li>
  <li>Second, Even the operation itself, it is also a space</li>
