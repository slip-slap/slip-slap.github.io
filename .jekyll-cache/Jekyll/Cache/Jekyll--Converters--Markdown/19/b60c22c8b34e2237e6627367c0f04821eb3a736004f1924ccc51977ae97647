<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>An inner product space is a vector space with an additional structure called an
inner product. This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the
space with a scalar quantity known as inner product.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For a very very very long time, I was suffered about the definition of inner
product, Oh my god, <strong>itâ€™s just a structure</strong>. And it catch the essential
properties of angle, length, and distance.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
<ol>
  <li>An inner product space is a vector space V over the field F together.
    <ul>
      <li>
\[\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle: V \times V \rightarrow F\]
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>As you can tell, here, we generalize the definiton of a function, and also the
notation also changed in a more general way.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conjugte symmetry 
\(\langle x, y\rangle=\overline{\langle y, x\rangle}\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Linearity
\(\begin{aligned}\langle a x, y\rangle &amp;=a\langle x, y\rangle \\\langle x+y,
z\rangle &amp;=\langle x, z\rangle+\langle y, z\rangle \end{aligned}\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>positive define
\(\langle x, x\rangle&gt;0, \quad x \in V \backslash\{\mathbf{0}\}\)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In Euclidean Gemometry, the dot product of the Cartesian Coordinates is a
algebraic operaton that takes two equal-length sequence of numbers and returns a
single numer</p>

<p>The dot product of two vector \(\mathrm{a}=\left[a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right]\) and \(\mathbf{b}=\left[b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{n}\right]\)</p>

\[\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}=a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\]

  <li>When I was a child, I use a ruler to get the length of the target.</li>
  <li>When I was in junior school, I use coordiate to calculate the length.</li>
  <li>When I was in hign school, I use vector to calculate the length.</li>
  <li>When I was a undergraduate, I still use vector to calculate the length</li>
  <li>When I was graduate, I still use vector to calculate the length</li>
  <li>When I was a doctor, I learn Functional Analysis, inner product is
introduced, just to calculate the length.</li>
