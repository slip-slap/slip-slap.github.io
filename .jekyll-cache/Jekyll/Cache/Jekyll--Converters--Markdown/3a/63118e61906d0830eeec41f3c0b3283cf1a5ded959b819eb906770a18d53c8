<ol>
  <li>Why it is called differential geometry?
    <ul>
      <li>because for some geometry object, it can be presented in differential form
$\frac{d q}{dt} = F(q(t),t)$, we want to study this object, just based on the
differential equation</li>
      <li>Trashed the coordinate system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
