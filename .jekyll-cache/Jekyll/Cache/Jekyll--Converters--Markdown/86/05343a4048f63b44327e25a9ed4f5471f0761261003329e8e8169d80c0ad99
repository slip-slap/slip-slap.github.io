  <li>Vatrix: A vatrix is matrix whose entries are all vectors(off the same size).</li>
  <li>Vatrix Algebra: we can take linear combinations of vatrices, if their entries
are the same size.</li>
</ol>

<p>Vector =(coefficent vector) $\times$ (basis vatrix)</p>

<h4 id="taylor-coefficient-vectors">Taylor Coefficient Vectors</h4>
<p>The space $P^3$ of polynomials of form $p=a+b\alpha+c\alpha^2+d\alpha^3$
has many bases. we can now organize these(ordered) bases by writing the
associated vatrices.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Express $P^3$ as a product of a Taylor coefficient vector and a Taylor basis
vatrix
$p=1+2\alpha+\alpha^2+-1\alpha^3$</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relations between different Taylor coefficient vectors is equivalent to
finding relations between Taylor basis vatrices.
