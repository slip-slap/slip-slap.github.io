  <li>Let $W$ be a finite set of states, where each state is to be understood as a complete specification
of the relevant facts about the world. An information partition is a partition $
\mathscr{I}
$ of $W$;
    <ul>
      <li>The elements of the partition are called informations sets. For every $w \in W$ we denote by $I(w)$ the information set that contains state $w$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $W$ be a set of states. We will call the subsets of W events. Let $\mathscr{I}$ be a
partition of W, E an event and $w \in W$ a state. We say that at $w$ the agent knows E if and
only if the information set to which $w$ belongs is contained in E.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We can define a knowledge operator K on events that, given as inpu any event E, produces as
output the event $KE$ defined as the set of states at which the agent knows $E$.</li>
</ol>
