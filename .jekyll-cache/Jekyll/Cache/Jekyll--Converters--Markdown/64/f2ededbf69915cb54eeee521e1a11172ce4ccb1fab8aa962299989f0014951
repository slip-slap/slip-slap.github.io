<p><strong>Order Statistics</strong>: Suppose now that $(X_1,\cdots, X_n)$ is a sample. In many
applications of statistics, we will have n data values where the assumption that
these arise as an i.i.d. sequence makes sense. It is often of interest, then, to
order these from smallest to largest to obtain the <em>order statistics:</em></p>

\[X_{(1)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}\]

<p>Here, $X_$ is equal to the $i$th smallest value in the sample $ X_{(1)},
\ldots, X_{(n)} $</p>

<p><strong>Example: Distribution of the sample maximum</strong>
Suppose $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$ are i.i.d.. so that $F_{X_1}=F_{X_2}=\cdots=F_{X_n}$.
Then the largest-order statistic $X_{(n)}=max(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)$ is the
maximum of these n random variables.</p>

<p>Now $X_{(n)}$ is another random variable. What is its cumulative distribution
function? We see that $X_{(n)} \leq x$ if and only if $X_i \leq x$ for all $i$,
hence,</p>

<p>\(\begin{aligned} F_{X_{(n)}}(x) &amp;=P\left(X_{(n)} \leq x\right)=P\left(X_{1} \leq
x, X_{2} \leq x, \ldots, X_{n} \leq x\right) \\ &amp;=P\left(X_{1} \leq x\right)
P\left(X_{2} \leq x\right) \cdots P\left(X_{n} \leq x\right)=F_{X_{1}}(x)
F_{X_{2}}(x) \cdots F_{X_{n}}(x) \\ &amp;=\left(F_{X_{1}}(x)\right)^{n} .
\end{aligned}\).</p>
