  <li>Human being can only understand things that are well structured, things that
can be subdivided into the trivial one, studying the properties of these
trivial things, then composing them together.</li>
  <li>In programming language, procedural programming, dividing big problems into
small, solve them. Integral these solution together.</li>
  <li>In physics, world is consists of  atoms, atoms consists of photon, and
proton. To some extent, human being canâ€™t divide these small beasts
anymore, we are sad. But we still want to nail it, string theory comes up,
basically, as the basic component, composing them together, we have the
world.</li>
  <li>In topology, number theory, group theory, and so on.</li>
  <li>Why this, because as a human being, we can only solve problem that are well
structured, thatâ€™s our limit and advantage.</li>
  <li>Our brain canâ€™t understand things with a basic struture.</li>
