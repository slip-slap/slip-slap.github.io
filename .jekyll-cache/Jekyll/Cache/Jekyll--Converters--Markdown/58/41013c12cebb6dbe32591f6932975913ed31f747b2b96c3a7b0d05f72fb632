<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<p>Many of the problems in mathematics share common features. For example, in
topology one is interested in knowing whether two topological spaces are
hommeomorphic and in group theory one is interested in knowing whether two
groups are isomorphic. This has given rise to the theory of categories and
functors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>With Algebraic Topology
Much of algebraic topology is the study of functors, for example, the homology,
cohomology, and homotopy functors. For a functor to be truly useful, it should
be simple enough to be computable, ye complex enough to preserve essential
features of the original category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With Smooth Manifold
Tangent bundle the differential forms, culminating in de Rham cohomology are
functors of smooth manifolds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A category is a system of related objects.
    <ul>
      <li>The objects do not live in isolation: there is some notion of map between
objects, binding them together.</li>
      <li>The essence of a category is composition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="terminology">Terminology</h4>
<ol>
  <li>arrows: which are also called morphisms, as functions.</li>
  <li>commutative diagram: a commutative diagram is a diagram such that all
directed paths in the diagram with same start and end points lead to the same
result.
    <ul>
      <li>commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in
algebra.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
