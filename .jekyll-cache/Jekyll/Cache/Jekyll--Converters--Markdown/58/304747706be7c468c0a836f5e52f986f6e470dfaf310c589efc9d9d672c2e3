<h4 id="theorem">Theorem</h4>
<p>A lattice L is distributive iff L does not contain a pentagon or a diamond</p>

<h4 id="distributive">Distributive</h4>

<p>$
(x \wedge y) \vee(x \wedge z)=x \wedge(y \vee(x \wedge z))
$</p>

<p>Lattices satisfying this are called modular and the class of modular lattices is
denoted by $\mathbf{M}$</p>
