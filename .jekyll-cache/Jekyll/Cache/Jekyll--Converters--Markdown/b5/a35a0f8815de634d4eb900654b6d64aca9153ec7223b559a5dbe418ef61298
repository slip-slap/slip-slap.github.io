  <li>
    <p>$\epsilon$-adherent points. Let $X$ be a subset of $R$, let $\epsilon&gt;0$, and
let $x \in R$. We say that x is $\epsilon-adherent$ to $X$ iff there exists a
$y \in X$ which is $\epsilon-close$ to x</p>
  </li>
  <li>Adherent points. Let $X$ be a subset of $R$, and let $x\in R$, we say that x
is an adheren point of X iff it is $\epsilon-adherent$ to $X$ for every
$\epsilon &gt; 0$</li>
  <li>Limit Points: Let $X$ be a subset of the real line. We say that x is a limit
point(or a cluster point)  of $X$ iff it is an adherent poin of X\{x}. We
say that x is an isolated point of $X$ if $x \in X$ and there exists some $
epsilon &gt; 0$ such that $|x-y|&gt;\epsilon$ for all $y \in$ X \{x}
    <ul>
      <li>remark: It turns out that the set of adherent points splits into the set of
limit points and the set of isolated points.</li>

  <li>Sometimes, we think we are so smart, we can nail any problems, actually, we
canâ€™t, we only know very little about the world.</li>
  <li>continuous functions are the only function that we know, we can study, so
many problem are unsolved.</li>
