  <li>How do we compare vectors in curved spaces?
    <ul>
      <li>We canâ€™t simply add or substract vectors between two different points in a
jurved space because the basis vectors between two different points in a
curved space becasue the basis vectors vary from point to point in the
space.</li>
      <li>If vector addition and subtraction does not make sense in a curved space,
then what can we do?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We can compare the directions of different vectors between points.
    <ul>
      <li>To do this, we need to parallel transport one vector to the other.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>the condition $\frac{dv^{\alpha}}{d\lambda} = 0$ means that the vector $v$ is
transported without any change to its length or direction</li>
  <li>In a curved space we will use this same idea but we will need to take into
account the variation in the basis vectors as we move from point to point.</li>
  <li>That means we need the covariant derivative of the vector $v$</li>
</ul>

\[\frac{D v^{\alpha}}{D \lambda}=\frac{d v^{\alpha}}{d \lambda}+\Gamma_{v
\beta}^{\alpha} v^{v} \frac{d x^{\beta}}{d \lambda}=0\]

<ul>
  <li>Notice the change in direction that has occurred during the course of its
journey aroud the loop. This change in direction is entirely due to the
curvature of the manifold.</li>

<p>Assumed a manifold with connection $(M,\mathscr{O},\mathscr{A},\nabla)$ 
Def: A vector field X on M is said to be parallelly transported along a smooth 
curve $\gamma : R \rightarrow M$ if the directional deriative of the vector field
is always zero if you go the direction of the tangent of the curve.
\(\nabla_{v_r}X=0\)</p>
