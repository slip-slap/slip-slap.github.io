  <li>A polyhedron is the three-dimensional version of a polygon: it is a chunk of
space with flat walls. In other words, it is a three-dimensional figure make
by gluing polygons together.
    <ul>
      <li>The word is Greek in origin, meaning many seated. The plural is polyhedra.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A regular polygon is a polygon with all its edges equal and all angles equal
    <ul>
      <li>a regular polyhedron is one whose faces are regular polygons, all congruent,
and having the same number of polygons at each vertex.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Angle defect: the angle defect at a vertex of a polygon is defined to be $2
\pi$ minus the sum of the angles at the corners of the faces at that vertex.
    <ul>
      <li>For instance, at any vertex of a cube there are three angles of $\frac{\pi}{2}$
so the angle defect is $\frac{\pi}{2}$</li>
      <li>You can visualize the angle defect by cutting along an edge at that vertex,
and then flattening out a neighborhood of the vertex into the plane.</li>
      <li>A little gap will form where the slit is: the angle by which it opens up is
the angle defect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
