  <li>A set of terminal symbols, sometimes referred to as ‚Äútokens‚Äù</li>
  <li>A set of nonterminals, sometimes called ‚Äúsyntactic variables‚Äù

side of the production, an arrow, and sequence of terminals and/or nonterminals, called the body
or right side of the production
    <ul>
      <li>The intuitive intent of a production is to specify one of the written forms of a construct</li>
      <li>If the head nonterminal represents a construct, then the body represents a written form of the
construct.</li>
