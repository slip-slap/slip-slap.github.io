  <li>Martingales: Let $X_0,X_1,X_2,\cdots$ be a markov chain. The chain is a
martingle if for all $n=0,1,2,\cdots$, we have $E(X_{n+1} - X_n|X_n)=0$, that
is, on average the chain‚Äôs value does not change, regardless of what the
current value $X_n$ actually is.
    <ul>
      <li>a special class of stochastic processes, they are characterized
by ‚Äústaying the same on average‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Let {$X_n$} be simple random walk with $p=1/2$, then $X_{n+1}-X_n$ is equal to
either 1 or -1, with probability 1/2 each. Hence, <br />
$E(X_{n+1}-X_n|X_n)=(1)(1/2)+(-1)(1/2)=0$ <br />
So {$X_n$} stays the same on average and is a maringale.</p>
