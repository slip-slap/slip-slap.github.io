<h4 id="register-allocation">Register Allocation</h4>
<p>A key problem in code generation is deciding what values to hold in what registers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Register allocation, during which we select the set of variables that will reside in registers at
each point in the program.</li>
  <li>Register assignment, during which we pick the specific register that a variable will reside in.</li>
</ol>
