<p>$d(xy)=xdy+ydx$</p>

<p>$
(x+dx)(y+dy)-xy=xdy+ydx+dxdy
$</p>
<ol>
  <li>Leibniz think $dxdy$ are too small, you can get rid of them.</li>
  <li>at that time the concept of “limit” havn’t appear. Newton has the same idea.</li>
  <li>As far as I am concerned, if you get rid of something, such as $dxdy$, and
they are not equal zero, the result will not be accurate.</li>
  <li>but the fact is opposite, it is <strong>accurate</strong>, although, there are some flaw
with this theorem. The result is <strong>accurate!!!</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-does-arithmetical-consist-of-">What does arithmetical consist of ?</h4>
<p>Addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and take roots <br />
J$\cdot$Gregory thinks that limit operation is also an arithmetical operation.</p>
