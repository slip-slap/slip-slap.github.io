  <li>$X(t,\omega)$
    <ul>
      <li>All these things about stochastic process just about the property of this function.</li>
      <li>if $t$ is fixed, this item refers to a random variable at time $t$.</li>
      <li>if $\omega$ is fixed, this item refers to a sample function.</li>
      <li>Donâ€™t treat $\omega$ as only the sample space of one random variable, itâ€™s the set of all random variableâ€™s sample space.</li>
      <li>Given a random variable, we give a sample. we give every random variable an input, which is the sample space.</li>
      <li>and all these samples form the sample function.</li>
    </ul>
