<p>Games where either the IDSDS procedure or the IDWDS leads to a unique strategy profile are not very
common. How can one then “solve” games that are not solved by either procedure? The notion of Nash
equilibrium offers a more general alternative.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Nash Equilibrium: Given an ordinal game in strategic form with two players, a strategy profile
$s^<em>} = (s_1^</em>,s_2^*) \in S_1 \times S_2$ is a Nash equilibrim if the following
two conditions are satisfied:
    <ul>
      <li>for every $s_1 \in S_1$, $
\pi_{1}\left(s_{1}^{<em>}, s_{2}^{</em>}\right) \geq \pi_{1}\left(s_{1}, s_{2}^{*}\right)
$</li>
      <li>for every $s_2 \in S_2$, $
\pi_{2}\left(s_{1}^{<em>}, s_{2}^{</em>}\right) \geq \pi_{2}\left(s_{1}^{*}, s_{2}\right)
$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="how-to-find-a-nash-equilibria">How to find a Nash equilibria</h4>
<p>A quick way to find the Nash equilibria of a two-player game is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In each column of the table underline the largest payoff of Player 1 in that column(if there are
several instances, underline them all)</li>
  <li>In each row underline the largest payoff of Player 2 in that row;</li>
  <li>If a cell has both payoffs underlined then the corresponding strategy profile is a Nash
equilibrium.</li>
</ol>
