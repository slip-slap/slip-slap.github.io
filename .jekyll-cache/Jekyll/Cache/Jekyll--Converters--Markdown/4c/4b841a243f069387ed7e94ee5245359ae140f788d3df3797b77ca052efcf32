  <li>Lebesgue integral: extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.</li>
  <li>Improper integral: a definite integral that has either or both limits infinite or an intergrand that approaches infinity</li>

<p>Let \({f\_n}\) be a sequence of real-valued measurable functions on a measure space. Suppose that the sequence converges pointwise to a function
f and is dominated by some integrable function g in the sense that.</p>
