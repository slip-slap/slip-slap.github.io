<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>Conjunction are linking words like and, or, but, then and because.</p>

<h4 id="basic-rule">Basic rule</h4>
<p>Conjunction allows(but not compel) the omission of all kinds of words after them.</p>

<h4 id="because-as-or-since">Because, as or since?</h4>

<h5 id="because">Because</h5>
<p>Because is more common than as and since, both in writing and speaking. When we
use because, we are focusing on the reason:</p>
<ul>
  <li>She spoke quietly because she didnâ€™t want Catherine to hear.</li>
</ul>

<p>We often put the because-clause at the beginning of a sentence, especially when
we want to give extra focus to the reason.</p>

<h5 id="as-and-since">As and since</h5>
<p>We often use as and since when we want to focus more on the result than the reason.
We usually put a comma before since after the main clause.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are rather expensive, since theyâ€™re quite hard to find.</li>
</ul>
