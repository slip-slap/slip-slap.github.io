<ol>
  <li>Environment Variables are like ordinary Variables, with the following
differences:
    <ul>
      <li>Scope: Environment variables have global scope in a CMake process. They are
never cached.</li>
      <li>Initialization: Initial values of the CMake environment variables are those of
the calling process. Values can be changed using the <strong>set()</strong> and
<strong>unset()</strong> commands.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
