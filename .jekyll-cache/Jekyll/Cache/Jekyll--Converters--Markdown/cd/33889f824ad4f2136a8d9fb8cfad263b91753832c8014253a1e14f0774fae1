<h4 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>We prefer concept which are from intuition, such as the tangent line of a curve
at a specific point, it is easy to understand.</li>
  <li>Speaking of structure, it’s not something intuitive, it’s pure mathematics</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>for example, in real anaysis, we build structure addition of two numbers.</li>
  <li>To mimick this property, we add structure on complex domain, what does it
mean? I don’t know, it’s just the structure we want to adopt.</li>
  <li>we can also adopt $\sigma$ and $\delta$ to define limit on complex number
domain.</li>
</ul>
