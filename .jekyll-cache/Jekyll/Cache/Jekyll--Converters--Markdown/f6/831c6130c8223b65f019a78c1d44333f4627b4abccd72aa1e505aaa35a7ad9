<ol>
  <li>Mathematics is of any interest can be explained in terms of sets, functions, and
relations.
    <ul>
      <li>In real analysis, function is defined.</li>
      <li>In group theory, function is defined to study relationship among groups, a new
terminology is coined which is homeomorphism to generalize the concept of
function.</li>
      <li>In topology, we want to study the relationship among different surfaces, how
to map from one surface to another, in nature, itâ€™s still function. we still
call this homeomorphism.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Actually, many terminology is used to describe the properties of the mapping.
    <ul>
      <li>Real analysis, surjective, injective, bijective</li>
      <li>Group theory, fixed point, stabilier, and orbit also used to describe the
properties of a map.</li>
      <li>In topology, homotopy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
