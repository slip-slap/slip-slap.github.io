<h4 id="chinese">Chinese</h4>
<p>I am a native Chinese speaker, but I don‚Äôt think I master this language at all.
Of coures, I understand what people are talking about, every topic, every areaa,
I can tell the small difference when people talk, the words, the tone. But the
problem lies in me is I can‚Äôt express myself in a very concise and efficient
way. I should master some words in different area.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, Chinese is the most important language in the world,
because the Chinese powerfull econemy capability, and military ability. But the
drawback of chinese is it is too difficult to master.</p>

<h4 id="english">English</h4>
<p>I have learn English for so many years. Currently, American is the most
powerfull country in the earth, and English is the most popular language, There
is no doubt about that.
I can listen pretty well, I can understand what people are talking about, and I
can express myself. But the problem is I should try to improve my express
capabality, more accurate, more fluent.</p>

<p>I favour english most, because in the world, english is the most common used
language in the world, for business, for communication, for techology, for
scientist, I should learn english.</p>

<h4 id="japanese">Japanese</h4>
<p>But at first I learn Japanese, it is completely a nightmare, I was too focused
on the meaning of every word in a phrase. I suffer a lot. I should treat them as
a whole, expeciall in the context of conversation, it will be much more easier.
Because Japanese language is influenced by Tang Dynasty and western countries, I
can learn Japanese pretty easily, and the problem lies me is the listening. I
should listen more, and memorize more words.</p>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<p>According to the experience that I learn language, here is some advices</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, you need to memorize words, it‚Äôs the building blocks.</li>
  <li>Second, listen, listen, and listen, listen different topics</li>
  <li>memorize the word that is often used in some specific area.</li>
  <li>Maybe, the most important thing is <strong>Talk to yourself at home</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, I love history, expecially world history, not only China or Japan,
I want to figure out, what the the other people is doing when China is in Tang
dynasty. Why Democracy and scitenist are very developed in Greece. I want to
know Napoleon, Alexander, Kublai Khan, Sultan. If you want to talk about movies,
you should the following famous movies, The shawshank Redemption, godfather, the
lord of the rings, pulp fiction, Inception, The matrix, seven samurai,
Crounching Tiger and hidden Dragon, The new world.</p>

<h4 id="galois-1">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>There is one word that confuse me a lot. According what I learn and express
english in a chinese way. ‚Äúlet‚Äù is the choice to ask someone to do something.
but, it‚Äôs not, in English, it is <strong>make</strong>, I think this is the most frequent
word in English, DON‚ÄôT forget it.</li>
  <li>You can‚Äôt translate one language to the other language literly, because there
is no words whose meaning are equivlant exactly between two different
language. Before I went abroad, some guy told me if you go japan, you must
master japanese. That‚Äôs so not true. Between two different language, the
difficult is not only the prounciation, but also the word choice, some
sentence make sense in your culture, but not in the other culture. You should
try to picture the scenario,  and pay attention to their word choices.</li>
