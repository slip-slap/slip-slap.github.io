<p>The category code of a character determines that character’s role in Tex</p>
<ul>
  <li>For instance, Tex assigns a certain role to letters, another to space characters.</li>
  <li>Tex attaches a code to each character that it reads. When Tex reads the
letter ‘r’, for example, it ordinarily attaches the category code 11 to it.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Tex will see that each of those characters has category code 11 and will
forward those characters ofr typesetting as part of the paragraph it is
building. However, Tex does not forward the character code alone bt, instead
it uses the pair of numbers(character code, category code) to calculate a
composite integer value called a character token.</li>
  <li>Tex sees a space character with category code 10.</li>
