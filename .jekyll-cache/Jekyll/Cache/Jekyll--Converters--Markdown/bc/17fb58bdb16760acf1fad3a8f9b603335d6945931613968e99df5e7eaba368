<p>The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism;
that is, given a particular group, we should be able to match it up with a known
group via an isomorphism.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order n is
isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}_n$</li>
  <li>Hence, we “know” all finite cyclic groups. It is probably not reasonable to
expect that we will ever know all groups;</li>
  <li>However, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between
groups in special cases.</li>
</ul>
