<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Every computer has one special bit. All other bits in a computer come from somewhere, they are set
on and off by other bits or switches.</p>
<ol>
  <li>This one special bit turns on and off all by itself. But there is nothing mysteriour about it, it
just goes on and off very regularly and very quickly.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="stepper">Stepper</h4>
<ol>
  <li>It has two inputs. One is called ‘clk,’ because this is where we connect a bit that is going on
and off, such as our original clock bit.</li>
  <li>The other input is called ‘reset,’ which is used to return the stepper back to step one.</li>
  <li>For outputs, it has a number of bits, each of which will come on for one complete clock cycle,
and then turn off, one after the other</li>
</ol>
