  <li>The one major disadvantage to assembly language over pure machine code is that you must frist
assemble and link a program before you can execute it.</li>
  <li>An assembler like Microsoftâ€™s Assembler(MASM) provides a large number of features for assembly
language prgrammaers. ALthough learning about these features takes a fair amount of time, they
are so useful that it is well worth the effort.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Assembler directives are special instructions that provide information to the assembler but do
not generate any code. Examples include the segment directive, equ, assume, and end. These
mnemonics are not valid 80x86 instructions. They are messages to the assember, nothing else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A pseudo-opcode is a message to the assembler, just like an assembler directive, howevery a
pseudo-opcode will emit object code bytes. Example of pseudo-opcodes include byte, word, dword,
qword, and tbyte. These instructions emit the bytes of data specified by their operands but they
are not true 80x86 machine instructions.</p>
