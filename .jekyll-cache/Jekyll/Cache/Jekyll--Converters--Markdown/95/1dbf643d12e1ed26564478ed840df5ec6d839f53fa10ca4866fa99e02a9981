  <li>Related Variables: Variables X and Y are related variables if there is any change in
the conditional distribution of Y, given X=x, as x changes</li>
  <li>Unrelated: We say that variables X and Y are unrelated if they are
independent.</li>
  <li>Response Variable and Predictor Variable: we think of Y as a dependent
variable(depending on X) and of X as an independent variable(free to vary).
Our goal, then, is to predict the values of Y given the value of X. In this
situation, we call Y the response variable and X the predictor variable.</li>
  <li>Confounding Variables:</li>
