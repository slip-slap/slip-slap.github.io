  <li>Planar: A graph is said to be embeddable in the plane, or planar, if it can
be drawn in the plane so that its edges intersect only at their ends.
    <ul>
      <li>Such a drawing of a planar graph G is called a planar embedding of G.</li>
      <li>A planar embedding $\tilde{G}$ of G can itself be regarded as a graph
isomorphic to G;</li>
      <li>the vertex set of $\tilde{G}$ is the set of points representing vertices of G,
the edge sef of $\tilde{G}$ is the set of lines representing edges of G.</li>
      <li>refer to a planar embedding of a planar graph as a plane graph.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Jordan Curve: A Jordan curve is a continuous non-self-intersecting curve
whose origin and terminus coincide.
    <ul>
      <li>Let J be a Jordan curve in the plane. then the rest of the plane is
partitioned into two disjoint open sets called the interior and exterior of J.</li>
      <li>We shall denote the interior and exterior of J, respectively, by <strong>int J and ext
J</strong>, and their closures by <strong>Int J and Ext J</strong>.</li>
      <li>
\[\operatorname{Int} J \cap \operatorname{Ext} J=J\]
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jordan curve theorem: states that any line joining a point in J to a point in
ext J must meet J in some point.</li>
</ol>
