  <li>Duality is a very important  property of categories because it doubles the
productivity of every mathematician working in category theory.
    <ul>
      <li>For every construction you come up with, there is its opposite;</li>
      <li>For every theorem you prove, you get one for free.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The construction in the opposite category are oftern prefixed with ‚Äúco‚Äù
    <ul>
      <li>so you have products and coproducts,</li>
      <li>monads and comonads</li>
      <li>cones and cocones</li>
      <li>limits and colimits</li>
      <li>There are no cocomonads though, because reversing the arrows twice gets us
back to the original state.</li>
    </ul>
