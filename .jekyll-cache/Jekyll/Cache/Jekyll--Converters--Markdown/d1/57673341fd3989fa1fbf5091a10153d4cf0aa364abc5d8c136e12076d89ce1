<p><strong>Counting Process:</strong> A stochastic process ${N(t), t \geq 0}$ is said to be a
counting process if $N(t)$ represents the total number of â€˜eventsâ€™ that have
occurred up to time $t$. Hence, a counting process $N(t)$ must satisfy</p>

<ol>
  <li>$N(t) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$N(t)$ is integer valued</li>
  <li>if $s \leq t$, then $N(s) \leq N(t)$</li>
  <li>For $s &lt; t$, $N(t) - N(s)$ equals the number of events that have occurred in
the interval $(s,t]$</li>
</ol>

<p>A counting process is said to possess independent increments if the numbers of
events that occur in disjoint time intervals are independent.</p>

<h4 id="poisson-combining">Poisson Combining</h4>
<p>The sum of many small independent arrival processes tends to be close to Poisson
even if the small processes are not.  In a sense, the independence between the
processes overcomes the dependence between successive arrivals in each process.</p>

<h4 id="splitting-a-poisson-process">Splitting a Poisson process</h4>
<p>Each arrival is switched to \({N_1(t);t&gt;0}\) with probabiity \(p\) and otherwise
goes to \({N_2(t);t&gt;0}\).  View the switch as a Bernoulli process independent of
\({N(t);t&gt;0}\). A \(p\) biased coin is flipped independently at each arrival</p>
