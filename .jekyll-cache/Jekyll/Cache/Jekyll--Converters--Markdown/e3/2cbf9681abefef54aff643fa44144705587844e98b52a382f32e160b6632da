<p>For some scalar field 
\(f: \mathbb{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)
the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve \(c \subset \mathbb{U}\) is defined as</p>

\[\int_{\mathcal{C}} f(\mathbf{r}) d s=\int_{a}^{b}
f(\mathbf{r}(t))\left|\mathbf{r}^{\prime}(t)\right| d t\]

<h5 id="remark">Remark</h5>
<p>A line integral of a scalar field is thus a line integral of a vector field
where the vectors are always tangential to the line.</p>

<h4 id="remark-1">Remark</h4>
<p>For a long time, I was so confused by the concept of field, what the crap is a
field. All of a sudden, I understand, I was so happy, it is just a map, we call
this a field just to generalize this phenomean.</p>
