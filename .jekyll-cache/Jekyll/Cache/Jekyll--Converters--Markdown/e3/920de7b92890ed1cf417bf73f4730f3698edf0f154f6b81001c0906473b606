<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Typedef(which is short for “type definition”) is a keyword that
creates an alias for an existing data type. To create such an alias, we use the
<em>typedef</em> keyword.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">distance_t</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// define distance_t as an alias for type double;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>By convention, typedef names typically use a “_t” suffix. This both
indicates that the name is a typedef. and helps prvent from naming collisions
with other types of identifiers.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="scope">Scope</h4>
<p>Scope if a property of an identifier, typedef identifiers follow the same
scoping rules as variable identifiers: a typedef defined inside a block has
block scope and is usable only within that block. whereas a typedef defined in
the global namespace has file scope and is usable to the end of the file.</p>

<h4 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h4>
<p>one purpose of having types is to make sure that variables are always used in the way that they were
intended to be used.</p>
<ol>
  <li>typedefs provide a level of abstraction away from the actual types being used, allowing you, the
programmer, to focus on the concept of just what a variable should mean.</li>
  <li>This makes it easier to write clean code, but it also makes if far easier to modify your code</li>
</ol>

  <li>it is header guard, this file will be included only once.</li>
  <li>try to avoid double including
    <ul>
      <li>header guard are little piece of codes protect the contents of a header from being copied more
than once.</li>
