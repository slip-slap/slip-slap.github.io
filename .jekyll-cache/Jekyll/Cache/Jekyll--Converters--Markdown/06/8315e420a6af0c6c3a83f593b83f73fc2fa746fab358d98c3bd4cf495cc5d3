or prudent.</p>

economical early on.</p>

<h4 id="adequate-and-sufficient">Adequate and sufficient</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Adequate and sufficient are very closely in meaning, and both describe a
situation where quantity meets the requirements but sufficient is slightly
more than adequate.</li>
  <li>Sufficient protection means enough protection, and the same is conveyed by
adequate protection, but adequate reflects a level that is barely covering
the requirements whereas sufficient reflect comfortable levels.
    <ul>
      <li>Adequate means just able to fulfill the requirements or the purpose. If
something is adequate, it implies that the quantities are not abundant or
overflowing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
