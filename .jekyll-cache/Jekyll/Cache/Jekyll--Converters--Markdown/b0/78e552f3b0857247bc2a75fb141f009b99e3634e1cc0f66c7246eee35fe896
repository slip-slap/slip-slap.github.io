<ol>
  <li>The fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ is especially useful when studying spaces of
low dimension, as one would expect from its definition which involves only
maps from low-dimensional spaces into $X$.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="terminology">Terminology</h4>
<p>As we prefer to write operation as addition, so loop is represented by
a+b+c=b+c+a = c+a+b, because it is a closed loop geometry, we call this a <strong>cycle</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>chain: is going to be a word for random element in this free abelian group of
random combination  with integer coefficient.</li>
  <li>boundary: final point minus initial point</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>This is an algebraic way to detect whether we have a cycle or not.</li>
</ul>
