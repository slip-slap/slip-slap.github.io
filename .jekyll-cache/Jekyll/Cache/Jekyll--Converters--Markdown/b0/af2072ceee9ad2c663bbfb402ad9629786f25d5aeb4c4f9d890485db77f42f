<h4 id="which">Which</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Putting a comma preceding which, which makes a sentence simple to read.
    <ul>
      <li>There is only so much that one can do with tangent vectors, which are
essentially arrows, but functions, far more flexible, can be added,
multiplied, scalar-multiplied, can composed with other maps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="preposition--which">preposition + which</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Another technique in least-squares is regularization, in which extra terms are
added to the cost function.</li>
  <li>Learning approach is the way teacher view the learning process, in which there are learning strategies with all his theories.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="remark">Remark</h5>
<p>Roughly specaking, the function of <em>Where</em> is similar to <em>which</em> when place it
before a clause, and the difference as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Where</em> is less formal, <em>in which</em> is more formal</li>
  <li><em>Where</em> is less specific. <em>At/in/on/to/into which</em> is more specific. If I
say, <em>the cup where I left the spoon, you might look for the spoon lying next
to, lying across, or resting inside the cup. At which is also less specific</em>,
but <em>on which</em> means the spoon lies across the cup, and <em>in which</em> means it
rests inside the cup.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="that">That</h4>
<ol>
  <li>I hope that the modesty of the scope allows the central ideas to emerage more clearly.</li>
  <li>The following examples shows that a function need not be real-analytic.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="is">is</h4>
<ol>
  <li>It is well known that least-squares and linear programming problems have a complete theory.</li>
  <li>It is used to find bounds on the optimal values.</li>
  <li>If we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="is-to">is to</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The central idea behind abstract algebra is to define a larger class of objects.</li>
