  <li>Array and list are the most important data structure, all the other data
structure is derivated from this two basic structure.</li>
  <li>String ,in nature, just array, but presents in a character way, no big deal.</li>
  <li>
    <p>computer are not born with array, they are gift provided by the compiler.
Donâ€™t take anything for granted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>It is not just array, given specific context, it can be used to stands for
anything.
    <ul>
      <li>In breadth first search, array is used to denote visited node, -1 can denotes
exist, 0 denotes nonexist</li>
      <li>In finding a pair of sum, array is used as the hashtable, element value in the
array is denoted whether they exist or not.</li>
      <li>In minimum spanning tree algorithm, array can be used to save the tree.
No matter whatever situation you are in, try to use array to denote related value,
describe the semantics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
