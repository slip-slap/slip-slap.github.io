<p>Recursive programming is a great way to show yourself that you can solve
difficult problems.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write an iterative function to solve the problem.</li>
  <li>Write a “dispatcher” function.
    <ul>
      <li>Dispatcher function solves problem for some “minimal” data set.</li>
      <li>in this case, when size parameter == 0</li>
      <li>Dispatcher calls iterative function to handle non-minimal cases</li>
      <li>must pass smaller data set to iterative function. in this case, passing size
-1 for third parameter does the trick.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In dispatcher, replace call to iterative function with call to dispatcher.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="linkedlist">LinkedList</h4>
<p>Recursion requires us to divide the problem, to be able to pass a reduced
version of the original problem to the recursive call. <strong>There is only one way to
divide a singly linked list: the first node in the list and the rest of the
list.</strong></p>

<h5 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h5>
<ol>
  <li>More complicated structures may require multiple recursive calls.</li>
  <li>For applying recursion, we will conceptualize trees as having three parts:
    <ul>
      <li>the node at the top, known as the root node;</li>
      <li>all of the nodes reached from the left link of the root, known as the left
subtree.</li>
      <li>all of the nodes reached from the right link of the root, known as the right
subtree.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes</h4>

<h5 id="global-variables">Global Variables</h5>
<ol>
  <li>The use of global variables is generally a poor programming pracice, although
it is sometimes permissible for performance reasons. <strong>Global variables
should always be avoided in recursive functions when possible</strong></li>
</ol>
