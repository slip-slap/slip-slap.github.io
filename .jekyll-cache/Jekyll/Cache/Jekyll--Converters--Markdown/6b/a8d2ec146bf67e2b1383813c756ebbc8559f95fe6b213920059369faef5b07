<ol>
  <li>Mathematicians have a love/hate relationship with set theory. Itâ€™s the
assembly language of mathematics - at least it used to be.
    <ul>
      <li>Category theory tries to step away from set theory, to some extent.</li>
      <li>For instance, the set of all sets doesnâ€™t exist, but the category of all sets,
$\textbf{Set}$, does.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, we assume that morphisms between any two objects in a
category form a set. We even called it a hom-set.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There is a branch of category theory where morphisms donâ€™t form sets. Instead
they are objects in another category. Those categories that use hom-objects
rather than hom-sets, are called enriched categories.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>
<p>A set is the closest thing to a featureless blob you can get outside of
categorical objects</p>
