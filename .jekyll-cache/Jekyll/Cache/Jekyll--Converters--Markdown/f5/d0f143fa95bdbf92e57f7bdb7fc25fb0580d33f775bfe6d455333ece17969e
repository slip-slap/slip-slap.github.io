<p>According to the name, Isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method.
It is one of several widely used low-dimensional embedding methods, it is for
computing a quasi-isometric, low-dimensional embedding of a set of
high-dimensioal data points. The algorithm provides a simple method for
estimating the <strong>intrinsic geometry of a data manifold</strong> on a rough estimate of
each data pointâ€™s neighbors on the manifold. Isomap is highly efficient and
generally applicable to a broad range of data sources and dimensionalites.</p>

  <li>Isomap is a combination of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm with classic
Multidimensional Scaling. Classic Multimensional Scaling takes a matrix of
pair-wise distances between all points and computes a position for each point.
Isomap assumesthat the pair-wise distances are only known between neighboring
points, and uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the pair-wise distances
between all other points. This effectively estimates the full matrix of
pair-wise geodesic distances between all of the points.</li>
  <li>Landmark-Isomap is a variant of this algorithm that uses landmarks to
increase speed, at the cost of some accuracy</li>
