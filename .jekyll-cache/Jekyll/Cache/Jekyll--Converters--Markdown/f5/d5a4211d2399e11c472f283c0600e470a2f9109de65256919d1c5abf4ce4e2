<p>if $\vec{v_1}$,$\vec{v_2}$,$\vec{v_3}$ are columns of A then,
\(\vec{v}_{1} \vee \vec{v}_{2} \vee \vec{v}_{3}=\Delta\left(e_{1} v e_{2} v
e_{3}\right)\)</p>

\[A=\left(\begin{array}{lll}{a} &amp; {b} &amp; {c} \\ {d} &amp; {e} &amp; {f} \\ {g} &amp; {h} &amp;
{i}\end{array}\right)\]

\[\begin{array}{l}{\left(a e_{1}+d e_{2}+g e_{3}\right) v\left(b e_{1}+e_{2}+h
e_{3}\right) v\left(c e_{1}+f e_{2}+i e_{3}\right)} \\ {=(a e i-a h f+b f g-b d
i+c d h-c e g)\left(e_{1} v e_{2} v e_{3}\right)}\end{array}\]

  <li>You could think of a determinant as a volume. Think of the columns of the matrix
as vectors at the origin forming the edges of a skewed box. The determinant
gives the volume of that box. For example, in 2 dimensions, the columns of the
matrix are the edges of a rhombus.</li>
  <li>You can derive the algebraic properties from this geometrical interpretation.
For example, if two of the columns are linearly dependent, your box is
missing a dimension and so itâ€™s been flattened to have zero volume.</li>
  <li>When you thinking the determinant in a geometric way. You can treat each
column or each row as one edge of the imaging box. The result is the same no
matter you treat each column as an edge or each row as an edge.

  <li>The determinant is a function from the set of square matrices into the real
numbers that preserves the operation of multiplication: <br />
  $det(AB)=det(A)det(B)$ <br />
  and so it carries some information about square matrices into the much more
  familiar set of real numbers</li>
  <li>The determinant function maps the identity matrix <em>I</em> to the identity element
of the real numbers, det(I)=1, which real number does not have a
multiplicative inverse? those which are <strong>mapped to 0 by the determinant</strong>
function. <br />
This operation preserving property of the determinant explains some of the
value of the determinant function and provides a certain level of intuition
for me in working with matrices.</li>
