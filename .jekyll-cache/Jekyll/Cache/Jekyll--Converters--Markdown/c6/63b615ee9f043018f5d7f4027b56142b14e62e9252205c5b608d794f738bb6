<h4 id="norm-space">Norm Space</h4>
<p>A normed vector space is a vector space over the real or complex numbers, on which a norm is defined.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The zero vector, 0, has zero length; every other vector has a positive length.</li>
  <li>Multiplying a vector by a positive number changes its length without changing its direction.</li>
  <li>The triangle inequality holds, That is, taking norms as distances, the distance from point A through B to C is never shorter than going
directly from A to C, or the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line.</li>

<h4 id="banach-space">Banach Space</h4>
<p>Banach space: a complete normed vector space. a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of 
vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges
to a well defined limit that is within the space.</p>
