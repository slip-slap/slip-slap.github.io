<ol>
  <li>Homogeneous coordinates: make calculations of graphics and geometry possible
in projective.</li>
  <li>Homogeneous coordinates are a way of representing N-dimensional coordinates
with N+1 numbers.</li>

<p>points(1,2,3),(2,4,6) and (4,8,12) correspond to the same Euclidean point
(1/3,2/3). And any scalar product,(1a,2a,3a) is the same point as (1/3,2/3) in
Euclidean space. Therefore, these points are <strong>homogeneous</strong> because they
represent the same point in Euclidean space. In other words, Homogeneous
coordinates are scale invariant.</p>
