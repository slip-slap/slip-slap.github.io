<h4 id="fuzzy-relations">Fuzzy Relations</h4>
<p>We start with crisp(non-fuzzy) relations and then generalize to fuzzy relations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If X and Y are two sets, then $X \times Y$ is the set of all ordered pairs
$(x,y)$ for $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.</li>
  <li>A crisp relation R between X and Y is a subset of $X \times Y$. So $R \cap X \times Y$</li>
  <li>$R(x,y)=1$ if and only if $x,y \in R$, That is, $R(x,y)=1$  if $(x,y)$  is in
R and $R(x,y)=0$ for $(x,y)$ not in R.</li>
  <li>$R(x,y)=1$ means that x and y are related(associated) through relation R.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="type-of-fuzzy-set">Type of fuzzy set</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The value of membership degree might include uncertainty. If the value of
membership function is given by a fuzzy set, it is a type-2 fuzzy set.
    <ul>
      <li>Type-2 fuzzy sets allow us to handle linguistic uncertainties, which can be
expressed as: ‚Äúwords can mean different things to different people.‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This concept can be extended up to Type-n fuzzy set.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fuzzy-rule">Fuzzy rule</h4>
<p>A fuzzy rule can be represented by a fuzzy relation $R= A \rightarrow B$</p>
<ul>
  <li>R can be viewed as a fuzzy set with a two dimensional membership function</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Example, If temperature is high, then humidity is fairly high
    <ul>
      <li>It is a fuzzy rule and a fuzzy relation</li>
      <li>To determine the membership function of the rule, Let T and H be univers of
discourse of temperature and humidity, respectively, and let us define
variables $t \in T$ and $h \in H$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="defuzzification">Defuzzification</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In many practical applications, a control command is given as a crisp value.</li>
  <li>A process to get a non-fuzzy control action that best represents the
possibility distribution of an inferred fuzzy control action.</li>
  <li>No systematic procedure for choosing a good defuzzification strategy.</li>
</ul>
