  <li>To see what these constraints are, we note that $a_n \gt 0$.</li>
  <li>You have to decide what is the appropriate notion of locality in this case.</li>
  <li>To better understand what is happening.</li>
  <li>We ask under what circumstances will a Markov chain converge to the desired distribution</li>
  <li>It has been difficult to know to what extent these solutions should be made
widely available.</li>
  <li>We did not discuss what form those basis functions might take.</li>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If none of the variables are observed, then we can investigate whether $a$ and $b$ are
independent by marginalizing both sides of (8.23) with respect to $c$ to give
\(p(a, b)=\sum_{c} p(a \mid c) p(b \mid c) p(c) \textstyle{.}\)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We might ask whether it is possible to define an alternative graphical
semantics for probability distributions such that conditional independence
is determined by simple graph separation.</p>
  </li>
