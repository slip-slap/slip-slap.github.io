<p>at a given point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the
point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different
directions at that point.</p>

  <li>Euler: normal curvatures had a maximum and minimum value in two perpendicular
directions, which are called principal directions.</li>
  <li>In differential geometry, the Gaussian curvature or Gauss curvature $K$ of a
surface at a point is the product of the principal curvatures, $k_1$ and
$k_2$ at the given point.</li>
</ol>

\[K = k_1k_2\]

  <li>A point $p$ on a regular surface $M\in R^3$ is said to be elliptic if the
Gaussian curvature $K(p)
    <blockquote>
      <p>0$, the principal curvatures $k_1$ and $k_2$ have the same sign. <strong>which means
the surface is on
the one side of the tangent plane.</strong>

  <li>one curve goes one side of the tangent plane, and the other curve goes the
other side of the tangent plane.</li>
  <li>Asympotic Lines: the curve tangent plane meets the surface.
the lines are flat, the center of the curvature is infinity.

<h4 id="parabolic-point">Parabolic Point</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A point $p$ on a regular surface $M\in R^3$ is said to be parabolic if the
Gaussian curvature $ K(p)=0$ but $s(p)\neq 0$(where $s$ is the shape
operator), or equivalently, exactly one of the principal curvatures $k_1$,
$k_2$ equals 0

  <li>Meusnier‚Äôs Theorem: If every point on a surface is umbilic, then the surface
is sphere or plane</li>
  <li>Umbilical Point In the differential geometry of surfaces, in three
dimensions, umbilics or  umbilical points are points on a surface that are
locally spherical. At such points the normal curvatures in all directions are
equal, hence, both principal curvatures are equal, and every tangent vector
is a principal direction. The name ‚Äúumbilic‚Äù comes from Latin umbilicus</li>
