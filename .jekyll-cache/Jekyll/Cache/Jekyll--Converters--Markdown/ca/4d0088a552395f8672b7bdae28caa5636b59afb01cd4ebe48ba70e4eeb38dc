  <li>Geometry, like arithmetic, requires for its logical development only a small
number of simple, fundamental principles.</li>
  <li>
    <p>These fundamental principles are called the axioms of geometry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The following investigation is a new attempt to chooose for geometry a simple
and complete set of independent axioms and to deduce from these the most
important geometrical theorems in such a manner as to bring out as clearly as
possible the significance of the different groups of axioms and the scope of
the conclusions to be derived from individual axioms.</li>

  <li>What is geometry? According to Klein, he considered geometry to be the study
of properties that are left uninvariant under transformation groups.</li>
