<p>one purpose of having types is to make sure that variables are always used in the way that they were
intended to be used.</p>
<ol>
  <li>typedefs provide a level of abstraction away from the actual types being used, allowing you, the
programmer, to focus on the concept of just what a variable should mean.</li>
  <li>This makes it easier to write clean code, but it also makes if far easier to modify your code</li>
</ol>
