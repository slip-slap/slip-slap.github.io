<h4 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h4>
<p>There are two major approaches to polymorphism in programming:</p>
<ol>
  <li>subtype polymorphism,  realized with inheritance and virtual functions:
interface requirements are written as virtual functions of an abstract class,
from which concrete classes are derived.</li>
  <li>parametric polymorphism, realized with generics or templates that specify a
class or function with type parameters.</li>
</ol>
