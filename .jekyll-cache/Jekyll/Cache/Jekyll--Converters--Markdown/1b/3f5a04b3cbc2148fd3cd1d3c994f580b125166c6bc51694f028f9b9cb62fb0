<h4 id="about-prior-belief">About prior belief</h4>
<p>Bayes theorem entails previous belief about the parameters of a distribution,
then the prior belief is came up. We use prior distribution as an implementation
tool for our prior belief, where <em>prior belief</em> is the core concept, and prior
distribution is a representation.</p>

<h5 id="1-prior-belief-with-bernoulli-distribution">1. Prior belief with bernoulli distribution</h5>
<p>The range of the parameter of a bernoulli distribution is from 0 to 1, so the
corresponding prior distribution, representing the prior belief, should has the
same domain. We find that beta function can satisfiy this constraint.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The parameters of beta function are called hyperparameters.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="2-prior-belief-with-gaussian-distribution">2. Prior belief with gaussian distribution</h5>
<p>The prior distribution of a gaussian distribution is still a gaussian
distribution.</p>
