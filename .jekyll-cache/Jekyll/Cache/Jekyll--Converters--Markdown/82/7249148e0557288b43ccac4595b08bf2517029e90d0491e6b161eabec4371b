<ol>
  <li>We have now constructed the integers, with the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and order and verified all the expected
algebraic and order-theoretic properties. Now we will use a similar
construction to build the rationals , adding division to our mix of
operations.</li>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A rational number is an expression of the form a//b where a and b are
integers and b is non-zero; a//0 is not considered to be a rational number.
Two rational numbers are considered to be equal, $a//b = c//d$, if and only if
$ad = cb$, the set of all rational numbers is denoted $Q$</li>
</ol>
