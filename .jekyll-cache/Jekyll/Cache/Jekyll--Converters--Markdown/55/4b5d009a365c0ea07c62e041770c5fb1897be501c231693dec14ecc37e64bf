<p>The reason we are transforming our vertices into all these different spaces is that some operations
make more sense or are easizer to use in certain coordinate systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, when modifying your object it makes more sense to do this in local space, while
calculating certain operations on the object with respect to the position of other objects makes
more sense in world coordinate and so on.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Local coordinates are the coordinates of your object relative to its local origin; they’re the
coordinates your object begins in.</li>
  <li>The next step is to transform the local coordinates to world-space coordinates which are
coordinates in respect of a larger world. These coordinates are relative to a global origin of
the world, together with many other objects also placed relative to the world’s origin.
    <ul>
      <li>The coordinates of your object are transformed from local to world space, this is accomplished
with the model matrix</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next we transform the world coordinates to view-space coordinates in such a way that each
coordinates is as seen from the camera or viewer’s point of view.
    <ul>
      <li>The view space is what people ususaly refer to as the camera of OpenGL(it is sometimes also known
as the camera space or eye space)</li>
      <li>view matrix that transform world coordinates to view space.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After the coordinates are in view space we want to project them to clip coordinates. Clip
coordinates are processed to the -1.0 and 1.0 range and determine which vertices will end up on
the screen.
    <ul>
      <li>projection matrix: transform vertex coordinates from view to clip-space.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And lastly we transform the clip coordinates to screen coordinates in a process we call viewport
transform that transforms the coordinate from -1.0 and 1.0 to the coordinate range defined by
glViewport. The resulting coordinates are then send to the rasterizer to turn them into
fragments.</li>
