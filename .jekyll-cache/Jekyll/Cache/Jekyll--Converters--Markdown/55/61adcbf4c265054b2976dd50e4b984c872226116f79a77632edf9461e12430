  <li>One way of measuring the arclength geometrically is by imaging the curve as a
thread that can be stretched out and measured. This, however, doesnâ€™t really
help in formulating how it should be measured mathematically</li>
  <li>Archimedes succeeded in understanding the arclength of circles by relating it
to the area of the circle</li>
  <li>The idea of measuring the length of general curves is relatively recent,
Newton was the first to give the general definition that we should use.</li>
