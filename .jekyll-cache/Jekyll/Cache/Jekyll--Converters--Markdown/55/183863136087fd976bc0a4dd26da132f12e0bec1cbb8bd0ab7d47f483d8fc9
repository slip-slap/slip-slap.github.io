  <li>order: the number of highest derivative in a differential equation.</li>
</ol>

<p>\(y^{\prime \prime}+x y^{\prime}-x^{3} y=\sin x\)
is second order since the highest derivative is \(y^{\prime \prime}\) is the second derivative.</p>
<ol>
  <li>degree: In mathematics, the degree of a differential equation is the power of its highest derivative.</li>
</ol>

  <li>trivial solution: a solution or example that is riduculously simple and of little interest. Often solutions or examples involving the number
0 are considered trivial. Nonzero solution or examples are considered nontrivial.
For example:
\(x+5 y=0\)
has the trivial solution x=0, y=0. Nontrivial solutions include x=5, y=-1</li>
  <li>particular solution:</li>

<ol>
  <li>homogenous differential equation: a differential equation is homogeneous when it can be this form:
\(\frac{d y}{d x}=F\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\)</li>
</ol>

  <li>When we learn differential equation, we should focus on numberical
solution, instead of analytical solution</li>
  <li>Because all the possible analytical solution has been find, but with computer
software, we can find any numberical solution.</li>
</ol>
