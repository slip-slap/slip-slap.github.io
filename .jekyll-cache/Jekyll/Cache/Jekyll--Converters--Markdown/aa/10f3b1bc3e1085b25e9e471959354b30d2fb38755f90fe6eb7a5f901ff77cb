  <li>Scalar Field: If to each point $(x,y,z)$ of a region R in space there corresponds a number
or scalar $ \phi(x, y, z) $, then $\phi$ is called scalar function of
position or scalar point function and we say that a scalar filed $\phi$ has
been defined in R.
    <ul>
      <li>A scalar field which is independent of time is called a stationary or
steady-state scalar field</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vector Field: If to each point $(x,y,z)$ of a region R in space there
Vcorresponds a vector $ \mathbf{V}(x, y, z) $, then $\mathbf{V}$ is called a
vector function of position or vector point function and we say that a vector
field $\mathbf{V}$ has been defined in R.</li>
