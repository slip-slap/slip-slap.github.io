<p>Every computer has one special bit. All other bits in a computer come from somewhere, they are set
on and off by other bits or switches.</p>
<ol>
  <li>This one special bit turns on and off all by itself. But there is nothing mysteriour about it, it
just goes on and off very regularly and very quickly.</li>
</ol>
