<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>We can express any finite abelian group as a finite direct product of cyclic
groups. More specifically, letting  $p$ be prime, we define a group G to be
$p-group$ if every element in G has its order a power of p</p>
<ul>
  <li>For example, both $\mathbf{Z}<em>2$ and $\mathbf{Z}_2$ and $\mathbf{Z}_4$ are
2-groups, where $\mathbf{Z}</em>{27}$ is a 3-group.</li>
  <li>Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic
p-groups</li>
</ul>
