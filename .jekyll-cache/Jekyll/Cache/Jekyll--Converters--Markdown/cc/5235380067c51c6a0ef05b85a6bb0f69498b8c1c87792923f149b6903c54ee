<p>A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner
product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthmore, Hilbert spaces
are complete.</p>

  <li>injective: an injective function is a function that maps distince elements of
its domain to distinct elements of its domain.
    <ul>
      <li>means we won’t have two or more “A” pointing to the same “B”, but we can have a “B” without a matching “A”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>surjective: a function f from a set X to a set Y is surjective(also known as
onto), if for every element y in the codomain Y of f, there is at least one
element x in the domain X of f such that $f(x)=y$
    <ul>
      <li>The French word <strong>sur</strong> means over or above, and relates to the fact that the
image of the domain of a surjective function completely covers the function’s</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>means every “B” has at least one matching “A”. There won’t a B left out.
    <ol>
      <li>bijective:  means both injective and surjective, so there is a perfect one-to-one correspondence between the members of the sets.
bijective function has an inverse.</li>
      <li>onto: used as a function word to indicate a set each element of which is the <strong>image</strong> of at least one element of another set. &lt;a function mapping 
mapping the set S onto the set T&gt;
