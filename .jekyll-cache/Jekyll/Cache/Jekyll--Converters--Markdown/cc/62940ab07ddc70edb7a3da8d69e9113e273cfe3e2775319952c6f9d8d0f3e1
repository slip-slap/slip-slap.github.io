  <li>The xy-plane in $R^3$ is the prototype of a regular submanifold of a
manifold. It is defined by the vanishing of the coordinate function z.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>A subset S of a manifold N of dimension n is a regular submanifold of dimension
k if for every $p\in S$ there is a coordinate neighborhood $
(U, \phi)=\left(U, x^{1}, \ldots, x^{n}\right)
$ of p in the maximal atlas of N such that $
U \cap S
$ is defined by the vanishing of n-k of the coordinate functions. By renumbering
the coordinates, we man assume that these n-k coordinates functions are $
x^{k+1}, \ldots, x^{n}
$</p>
