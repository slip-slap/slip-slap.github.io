<h4 id="sequence">Sequence</h4>
<p>a sequence is a function with a domain equal to the set of positive integers.</p>

<h4 id="convergence-of-sequence">convergence of sequence</h4>
<p>Monotone convergence theorem: if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a supremum, then the sequence will converge to the supremum.</p>

<h4 id="series">Series</h4>
<p>a series is a list of numbers with addition operations between them.</p>

<h4 id="convergence-of-sequence-1">convergence of sequence</h4>
<p>As for sequence of functions, and unlike for series of numbers, there exist man types of convergence for a function series, such as
uniform convergence, pointwise convergence, almost everywhere convergence.</p>

<ol>
  <li>uniform convergence: uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, but not the other way around.</li>
  <li>almost everywhere convergence: A weakened version of pointwise convergence hypothesis which states that, for X a measure space,</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="method-of-determining-whether-a-series-converges-or-divergs">method of determining whether a series converges or divergs</h4>

<ol>
  <li>comparsion test</li>
  <li>ration test</li>
  <li>root test</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="function-series">Function series</h4>
<p>Function series: a function series is a series, where summands are not just real or complex numbers but functions</p>

<h4 id="p-series">P Series</h4>

\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{p}}\]

<h4 id="harmonic-series">Harmonic Series</h4>

<h4 id="power-series">Power Series</h4>

\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(x-c)^{n}=a_{0}+a_{1}(x-c)^{1}+a_{2}(x-c)^{2}+\cdots\]

<h4 id="taylor-series">Taylor Series</h4>
<p>Taylor Series: a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the functionâ€™s derivative at 
a single point.</p>

<h4 id="thinking">Thinking</h4>
<p>Taylor expansion is very interesting, a function can be represents by a sum of terms <br />
<strong>what do these terms stand for?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>The shape of a curve is decide by its derivative</li>
  <li>Assumed a point on the curve, the position of the following point on the curve is decided by the derivative of the current point.</li>
  <li>the shape of the function of derivative is decided by the second order derivative of the current point.</li>
  <li>â€¦, and so on</li>
  <li>So we can represent the function with Taylor expansion. This is amazing!!!</li>
