<h4 id="bfs">BFS</h4>
<p>BFS stands for Breadth First Search is a vertex based techinique for finding
   a shortest path in graph.</p>
<ol>
  <li>It uses a Queue data structure which follows first in first out. In BFS, one
  vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent
  are visited and stored in the queue.
    <ul>
      <li>step 1: visiting a vertex</li>
      <li>step 2: exploration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>Graph just as the other abstract data type, why we need to study how to visit node
in a graph, because things turn a little complicate now, array, stack, tree,
visiting each element is a very simple things.</li>
  <li>BFS is one strategy that we visit every node in the graph, and another thing
we gain is <strong>the approach to find shortest path from one source to the other
nodes in the graph</strong></li>
