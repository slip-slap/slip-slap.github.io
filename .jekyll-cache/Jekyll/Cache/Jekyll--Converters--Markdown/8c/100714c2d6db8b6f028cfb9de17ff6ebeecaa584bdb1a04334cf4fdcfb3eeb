<h4 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>We prefer concept which are from intuition, such as the tangent line of a curve
at a specific point, it is easy to understand.</li>
  <li>Speaking of structure, it’s not something intuitive, it’s pure mathematics</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>for example, in real anaysis, we build structure addition of two numbers.</li>
  <li>To mimick this property, we add structure on complex domain, what does it
mean? I don’t know, it’s just the structure we want to adopt.</li>
  <li>we can also adopt $\sigma$ and $\delta$ to define limit on complex number
domain.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-is-algebra">What is algebra?</h4>
<p>We already get used to addition, multiplication, and division. All the
operations manipulate two elements, so they are called binary operation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why the operation has to be binary? Could it be unary,n-ary ? Yes, it can.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="galois">Galois</h4>
<ol>
  <li>From linear algebra, bool algebra, lattice theory, group thoery, to lie
algebra. We came a long way. But there are some pattern among them.
    <ul>
      <li>construction: we, people, human being, our understanding is very limited. We
can only understand something very basic, and we believe complex things are
build based on simple pattern, isn’t that our limitation. Anyway, in number
theory, the construction is simple 1 + 1  = 2.</li>
    </ul>
