  <li>How do we compare vectors in curved spaces?</li>
  <li>We canâ€™t simply add or substract vectors between two different points in a
jurved space because the basis vector</li>

<p>Assumed a manifold with connection $(M,\mathscr{O},\mathscr{A},\nabla)$ 
Def: A vector field X on M is said to be parallelly transported along a smooth 
curve $\gamma : R \rightarrow M$ if the directional deriative of the vector field
is always zero if you go the direction of the tangent of the curve.
\(\nabla_{v_r}X=0\)</p>
