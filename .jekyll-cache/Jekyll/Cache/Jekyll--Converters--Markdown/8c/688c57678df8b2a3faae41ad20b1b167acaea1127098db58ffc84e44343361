<p>A functor is a very simple but powerful idea. Category theory is just full of
those simple but powerful ideas.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you picture a category as a collection of objects held together by a
network of morphisms, a functor is not allowed to introduce any tears into
this fabric. It may smash objects together, it may glue multiple morphisms
into one, but it may never break things apart.</li>
  <li>This no-tearing constraint is similar to the continuity condition you might
know from calculus.</li>
  <li>Just like functions, functors may do both collapsing and embedding. The
embedding aspect is more prominent when the source categroy is much smaller
than the target category.</li>
  <li>In the extreme, the source can be the trivial singleton category, a category
with one object and one morphism(the identity).</li>
  <li>A functor from the singleton category to any other category simply selects an
object in that category.</li>
  <li>The maximally collapsing functor is called the constant functor $\nabla_c$.
It maps every object in the source category to one selected object in the
target category, it also maps every morphism in the source category to the
identity morphism $\mathbf{id}_c$.
    <ul>
      <li>It acts like a black hole, compacting everything into one singularity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
