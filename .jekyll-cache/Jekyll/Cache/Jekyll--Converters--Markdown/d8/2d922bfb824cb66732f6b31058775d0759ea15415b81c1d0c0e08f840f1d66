  <li>A game-frame in strategic form is a list of four items(a quadruple) \(\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}\right), O, f\right\rangle\) where :
    <ul>
      <li>$I = {1,2,\cdots,n}$ is a set of players</li>
      <li>\(\left(S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}\right)\) is a list of sets, one for each player, for every Player $i \in I$, $S_i$ is
the set of strategies of Player $i$. We denote by S the Cartesian product of
these sets: \(S=S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \cdots \times S_{n}\); thus an element of S is a list $s = (s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n)$ consisting of one
strategy for each player. We call S the set of strategy profiles.</li>
      <li>$O$ is a set of outcomes</li>
      <li>\(f: S \rightarrow O\) is a function that associates with every strategy profile s an outcome $f(s)
\in O$</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An ordinal game in strategic form is a quintuple \(\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, \ldots, S_{n}\right), O, f,\left(\succsim_{1},
\ldots, \succsim_{n}\right)\right\rangle\)
    <ul>
      <li>\(\left\langle I,\left(S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}\right), O, f\right\rangle\) is a game-frame in strategic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>\(o \succsim_{i} o^{\prime}\), Player $i$ considers outcome $o$ to be at least as good as $o^{\prime}$</li>
  <li>\(o \succ_{i} o^{\prime}\), Player i considers outcome $o$ to be better then $o^{\prime}$</li>
  <li>\(o \sim_{i} o^{\prime}\), Player i considers outcome $o$ to be just as good as $o^{\prime}$</li>
</ol>

  <li>Ordinal utility function: Given a complete and transitive ranking \(\succsim\) of a finite set of outcomes O, a function \(U: O \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) (where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the set of real numbers) is said to be an ordinal
utility function that represents the ranking \(\succsim\), for every two
outcomes $o$ and $o^{\prime}$, \(U(o)&gt;U\left(o^{\prime}\right)\) if and only if \(o \succ o^{\prime}\) and \(U(o)=U\left(o^{\prime}\right)\) 
and only if \(o \sim o^{\prime}\)</li>
</ol>

<p>####</p>
<ol>
  <li>strict dominance: $a$ strictly dominates $b$(or $b$ strictly dominated by $a$) if, in
every situation(that is, no matter what the other players do), $a$ gives
Player $i$ a payoff which is greater than the payoff that $b$ gives.
Formally: for every \(s_{-i} \in S_{-i}, \pi_{i}\left(a, s_{-i}\right)&gt;\pi_{i}\left(b,
s_{-i}\right)\)</li>
  <li>weak dominance:</li>
</ol>
