  <li>Galois(1811-1832) had used group theory to solve algebraic (polynomial)
equations that were quadratic, cubic, and quartic.
    <ul>
      <li>He was able to prove that no closed form solution could be constructed for the
general quintic(or any higher degree) equation using only the four standard
operations of arithmetic as well as extraction of the nth roots of a complex
number</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lie initiated his program on the basis of analogy. If finite groups were
required to decide on the solvability of finite-degree polynomial equations,
then ‘infinite groups’ would probably be involved in the treatment of
ordinary and partial differential invariance.
    <ul>
      <li>Further, Lie knew that the structure of the polynomial’s invariance group not
only determined whether the equation was solvable in closed form, but also
provided the algorithm for constructing the solution in the case that the
equation was solvable</li>
      <li>He therefore felt that the structure of an ordinary differential equation’s
invariance group would determine whether or not the equation could be solved
or simplified and, if so, the group’s structure would also provide the
algorithem for constructing the solution or simplification.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Lie group is a geometry object, like a curve.
    <ul>
      <li>how we study a curve, we obtain it’s derivative function, if we know it’s
derivative function, we know this curve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lie group is this special geometry object, and lie algebra is it’s
derviative.</li>
  <li>The Lie algebra is an indispensable tool for studying a matrix group. It
contains a surprising amount of information about the group, especially
together with the Lie bracket operation.</li>
  <li>Why this name? It must mean something.
    <ul>
      <li>Why it’s called Lie Algebra, it’s an analogue.</li>
      <li>Because Lie group is an geometry object, we put something on this, we refer it
as Lie algebra.</li>
