<p>Life is unfair, you love somebody so much, but she didnâ€™t love you back.</p>

<h4 id="the-one-i-loved">The one I loved</h4>

<p>Itâ€™s a sad story, I felt I had a feeling for her after I saw her, and I was
incredible attacted to her. I wrote her a love letter.</p>

<p>It has been three years, I just canâ€™t get her out of my mind, although I canâ€™t
picture her appearance in my mind. Sometimes I wake up in the midnight, just
imaging some guy taking off her clothes and fucking her, I canâ€™t stand with
that. Althogh she is a bitch, I admit it.</p>

<h4 id="the-one-who-loved-me">The one who loved me</h4>
<p>I slept with her, and then dumped her up.</p>
