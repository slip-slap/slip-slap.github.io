<ol>
  <li>The derivative is the rate of change of y, as times goes forward, are partly depending on the solution itself.
    <ul>
      <li>Thatâ€™s the idea of differential equation.</li>
      <li>It connect the changes with the function y as it is.</li>
      <li>and then you have $q(t)$ which produces their own change. They go into the system, and the become part of the y.</li>
      <li>and they grow, decay, oscillate, whatever y of t does.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
