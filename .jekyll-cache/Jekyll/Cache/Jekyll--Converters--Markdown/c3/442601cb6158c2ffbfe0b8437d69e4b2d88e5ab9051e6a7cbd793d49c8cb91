<p>If X is an $n \times n$ matrix, we define the exponential of $X$, denoted by
$e^{X}$ or $exp X$, bu the usual power series
$
e^{X}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{X^{m}}{m !}
$</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where $X^0$ is defined to be the identity matrix $I$ and where $X^m$ is the
repeated matirx product of X with itself.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>GL(N,R): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is real number</li>
  <li>GL(N,C): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is complex number</li>
  <li>
    <p>GL(N,Q): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is quaternion number 
<br /></p>
  </li>
  <li>Operation: I said itâ€™s a group, I should tell you the group operation. The 
operation are matrix multiplication.</li>
  <li>Element: All invertible $N \times N$ matrices with entries from corresponding
field.</li>
</ol>

A Vector space, given the basis unit, a certain field, vector space scalar and
multiplication, inner product. Thatâ€™s all we need for a vector space.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The relationship between Lie group and Lie Algebra, first, we have Lie group,
and we want to study the properties of Lie group, so we call it lie algebra.
    <ul>
      <li>Why we have this thing? How this come out?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the original idea behind all this crap?
    <ul>
      <li>because we can treat a $su(3)$ as an geometry, general speaking, a manifold.</li>
      <li>A manifold is an object, we want to find a line through this manifold, oh my
god, this is so abstract</li>
      <li>How to find the line? With this line we can connect the dots, put everything
together.</li>
      <li>Mathematician use analogue, they are amazing!!! Full respect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
