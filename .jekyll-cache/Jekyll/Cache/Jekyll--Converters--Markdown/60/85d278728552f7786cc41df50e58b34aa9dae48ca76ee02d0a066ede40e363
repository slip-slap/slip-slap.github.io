<p>“Hold an apple in your hand, Is it an apple?” Yes, The object in your hand
belongs to the clumps of space time we call the set of apples - all apples
anywhere. Now take a bit, chew it, swallow it. Let your digestive track take
apart the apple’s molecules. Is the object in your hand still an apple? Yes or
no? Take another bite. Is the new object still an apple?” (Kosko 1992)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initially the apple is clearly an apple. But as the number of pieces bitten
off increases it gradually losses the property of “apple-ness”. At the end,
when the apple has been completely eaten, it is no longer a member of class
of apples.</li>
  <li>The basic idea of fuzzy logic is to associate a number with each object indicating the degree to which it belongs to a particular class of objects.</li>
  <li>The function that associates a number with the object is called the membership function.</li>
  <li>In classical set theory this function is either 1(the object belongs to the set) or 0 (the object does not belong to the set;) it is also called the “characteristic” function</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="with-randomness">With Randomness</h4>
<p>This is by no means the case.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fuzziness is a kind of intrinsic property of elements of categories</li>
  <li>Probability applies to any event in the real world.
Thus, in the real world we have both,probability and fuzziness.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>fuzziness describes the lack of distinction of an event</li>
  <li>chances describes the uncertainty in the occurrence of the event.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Suppose you are seateed at a table on which rest two glasses of liquid.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The liquid in the first glass is described to you as having a 95% chance of
being healthfule and good.</li>
  <li>The liquid in the second glass is described as having a 0.95 membership in
the class of “healthful and good” liquids.
    <ul>
      <li>Which glass would you select, keeping in mind that the first glass has a 5%
chance of being filled with nonhealthful liquids, including poisons.(Bezdek,1993)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>When I was in elementry school, my math teacher said, how to define a man is
bold or not by the amount of hair he has. When there is only one hair left,
he is bold, what if he has two, three? How to define a sunny day?</li>
