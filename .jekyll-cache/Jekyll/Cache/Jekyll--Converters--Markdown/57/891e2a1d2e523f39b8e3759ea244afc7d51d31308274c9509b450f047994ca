  <li>$W_0 = 0$</li>
  <li>$W$ has indendent increments: for every $t&gt;0$, the future $W_{t+u} - W_{t}$,
are independent of the past values $W_s$.</li>
  <li>$W$ has Gaussian increments: $W_{t+u} - W_t$ is normally distributed with
mean 0 and variance $u$, $ W_{t+u}-W_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, u) $</li>
  <li>$W$ has continuous paths: $W_t$ is continuous in t</li>
</ol>
