  <li>Sample space: there elements in that sample space</li>
  <li>events:   events are subsets of the sample space.</li>
  <li>sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points ‚Äìfrom Merriam Webster</li>
  <li>according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, it‚Äôs a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.</li>

  <li>$X(t,\omega)$
    <ul>
      <li>All these things about stochastic process just about the property of this function.</li>
      <li>if $t$ is fixed, this item refers to a random variable at time $t$.</li>
      <li>if $\omega$ is fixed, this item refers to a sample function.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt treat $\omega$ as only the sample space of one random variable, it‚Äôs the set of all random variable‚Äôs sample space.</li>
      <li>Given a random variable, we give a sample. we give every random variable an input, which is the sample space.</li>
      <li>and all these samples form the sample function.</li>
    </ul>
