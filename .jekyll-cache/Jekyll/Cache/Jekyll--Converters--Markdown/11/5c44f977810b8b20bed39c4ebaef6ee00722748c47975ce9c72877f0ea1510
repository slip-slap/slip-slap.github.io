  <li>Drawback:  The maximum likelihood network will exhibit a conditional
independence only when that independence happnes to hold exactly in the
empirical distribution.  Due to statistical noise, exact independence almost
never occurs, and therefore, in almost all cases, the maximum likelihood
network will be a fully connected one. In other words, the likelihood score
overfits the training data, learning a model that precisely fits the
specifics of the empirical distribution in our training set. This model
therefore fails to generailize well to new data cases: these are sampled from
the underlying distribution, which is not identical to the empirical
distribution in our training set.</li>
