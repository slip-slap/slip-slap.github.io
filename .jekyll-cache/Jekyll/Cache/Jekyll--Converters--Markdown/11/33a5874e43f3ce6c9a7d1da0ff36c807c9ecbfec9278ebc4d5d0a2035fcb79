<p>A CPD(conditional probability distribution) needs to speciy a conditional
probability $P(x|pa_X)$ for every assignment of values $pa_X$ and $x$, but it
does not have to do so by listing each such value explicityly. We should view
CPDs not as tables listing all of the conditional probabilities, but rather a
functions that given $pa_x$ and $x$, return the conditional probability
$P(x|pa_x)$</p>
