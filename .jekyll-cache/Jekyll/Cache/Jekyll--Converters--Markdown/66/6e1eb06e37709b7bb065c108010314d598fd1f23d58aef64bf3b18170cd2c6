<h4 id="ruin-problem">Ruin Problem</h4>
<p>In this example, an entity(often described as a gambler or an insurance company)
has an amount of money which varies randomly with time, possibly with some
drift. The model considers the event that the amount of money reaches 0,
representing bankruptcy. The model can answer questions such as the probability
that this occurs within finite time, or the mean time until which it occurs.</p>
