<p>In geometry, inversive geometry is the study of those properties of figures that
are preserved by a generalization of type of transformation of the Euclidean
plane, called inversion. These transformations preserve angles and map
generalized circles into generalized circles, where a generalized circle means
either a circle or a line. Many diffcult problems in geometry become much more
tractable when  an inversion is applied.</p>
