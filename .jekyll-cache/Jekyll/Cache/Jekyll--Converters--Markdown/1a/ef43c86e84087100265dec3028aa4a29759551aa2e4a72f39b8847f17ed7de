<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>A game-frame in strategic form is a quadruple $
\left\langle I,\left(S_{i}\right)_{i \in I}, O, f\right\rangle
$ where:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$I={1, \cdots,n }$ is a set of players</li>
  <li>For every Player $i \in I$, $S_i$ is the set of strategies of Player $i$, As before, we denote by
$S=S_1 \times \cdots \times S_n$ the set of strategy profiles</li>
  <li>$O$ is a set of basic outcomes</li>
  <li>$
f: S \rightarrow \mathscr{L}(O)
$ is a function that associates with every strategy profile s a lottery over the set of basic
outcomes O.</li>
</ol>
