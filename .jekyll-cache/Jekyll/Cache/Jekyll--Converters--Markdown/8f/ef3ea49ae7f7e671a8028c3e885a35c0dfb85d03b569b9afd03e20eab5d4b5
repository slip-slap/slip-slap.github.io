<p>If V is a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space, let $GL(V)$ denote
the group of invertible linear transformations of V. If we choose a basis for V,
we can identify $GL(V)$ with $GL(n;R)$ or $GL(n;C)$. Any such identification
gives rise to a topology on $GL(V)$, which is easily seen to be independent of
the choice of basis. With this discussion in mind, we think of $GL(V)$ as a
matrix Lie Group. Similarly, we let $gl(V)=End(V)$ denote the space of all
linear operators from V to itself, which forms a Lie algebra under the bracket
$[X,Y]=XY-YX$</p>
