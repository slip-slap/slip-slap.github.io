<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>It is easy to fall into the trap of having a class of numberous constructors
where each one is taking a different number of parameters. The developer is
forced to instantiate the class with the correct combination of parameters on
each situation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This problem has a name, it is a popular anti-pattern called the <strong>telescoping
constructor</strong> and build pattern is the go-to solution for it.</li>
  <li>The Builder patternâ€™s main intent is to have the minimum number of overloading
constructors to support the construction of several representations of an
object.</li>
</ul>
