  <li>Stochastic processes which are processes that proceed randomly in time.</li>
  <li>We consider sequences $X_0,X_1,X_2,\cdots$ where $X_n$ represents some random
quantity at time n.
How do you prevent oil spills? <br />
How do you prevent nuclear plants from going off?<br />
How do you prevent nuclear weapons from falling in the hands of the wrong people?<br />
These again, are probability issues.<br />
If you say there is one change in a billion that something will happen, 3/4 people will say
thatâ€™s not acceptable. <strong>I donâ€™t want any risk, these people are fools</strong>, but unfortunately,
these fools outnumber those of us who have studied these issues.</li>

  <li>Sample space: there elements in that sample space</li>
  <li>events:   events are subsets of the sample space.</li>
  <li>sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points â€“from Merriam Webster</li>
  <li>according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, itâ€™s a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.</li>

  <li>probability and statistics is an apply subject. Knowledge we learn in
calculus, and set theory all can be used in this subject.</li>
  <li>Gamma function is from calculus, Jacobian matrix is also from calculus. They
all can be used to study probability and statistics.</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the difference between stochastic process and probability model?
    <ul>
      <li>In probability, you generate a sampling point one time.</li>
      <li>In stochastic process, you generate a sampling path one time.</li>
      <li>If you treat probability as function, because its factor is a variable.</li>
      <li>the stochastic is functional, becasue its factor is a function.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
