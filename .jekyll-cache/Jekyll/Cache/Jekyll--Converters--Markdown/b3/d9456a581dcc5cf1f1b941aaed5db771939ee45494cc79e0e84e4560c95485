<ol>
  <li>The fundamental group is a topological invariant and a homotopic invariant.</li>
  <li>Our goal is to devise a way to describe the fundamental group.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>In mathematics, a path in topological space X is a continuous function f from
unit interval I=[0,1] to X <br />
$
f: I \rightarrow X
$</p>

<h4 id="homotopic-path">Homotopic path</h4>

<h4 id="definition-1">Definition</h4>
<ol>
  <li>toological space: may be defined as a set of points, along with a set of
neighbourhoods for each point.</li>
  <li>
    <p>In topology, two continuous functions from one topological space to another
are called homotopic if one can be “continuously deformed into the other,
such a deformation being called a homotopy between two functions.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>The most important thing is to convince ourself, this object is realy a
group.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="group">Group</h4>
<p>$\pi (m, x_0) $ is a group, with technically mathmatically theory of a group.</p>
<ol>
  <li>closed</li>
  <li>identity element: constant loop, the loop doesn’t go anywhere, just stay at
$x_0$</li>
  <li>associativity</li>
  <li>inverse element</li>
</ol>

<p>Why we are interested in subspace, it’s just like the subgroup in the group
theory !!!!!!!!! <br />
These guys are co clever!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
