#### Template 1
The formula be written as
	$a=b+1$,
	$c=m^2$,
where 
	$a=1$,
	$b=2$.

#### Template 2
From equation (2.94), the stress in the local are given by

$a = b + c$,
$c = d + f$,

where d and f are in units of MPa.

#### Template 3
Newton's second law of motion, ma=f, is maybe one of the first differential equations written.

####
The negation of 3
