#### Background
1. A typeclass defines a family of types that support a common interface

#### Grammer
1. $\textbf{class Eq a where}$, this means that we're defining a new typeclass
  that's called $\textbf{Eq}$. 
- $\textbf{a}$ will play the role of the type, it doesn't have to be called
  $\textbf{a}$
