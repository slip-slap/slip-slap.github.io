#### Background
1. Haskell's combination of purity, higher order functions, parameterized
   algebraic data types, and typeclasses allows us to implement polymorphism on
   a much higher level than possible in other languages.

2. Functor is a typeclass, which is basically for things that can be mapped
   over.
