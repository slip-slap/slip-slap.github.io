#### terminology
1. key: in the context of data structure, a key is a value used to identify a
   certain component of a data structure.


#### Notation
$\leftarrow$ denotes assignment

```code
Algorithm Largest Number
    Input: a list of numbers
    Output: the largest number in the list

    if L.size = 0 return null
    largest ←  L(0)
    for each item in L, do
        if item > largest, then
            largest ←  item
return largest
```

#### Analyze
1. time 
2. space
3. power


#### Design
1. Optimization Problem
- greedy method
- dynamic programming
- branch and bound



#### Difference between Algorithm and Programming Language
1. design        implementation
2. any language  programming language
3. analyse       testing
4. Hardware Independent   hardware dependent

#### Galois
1. If you know Chinese, "树" means tree; If you know japanese,'き' means tree;
   If you can draw, probably you can draw a picture, and everyone knows it is a tree.
   but how could a computer knows a tree.
2. computer representation is very interesting, it's fun. Suppose the only two
   things we have is array and linked list, given these two things, How should
   we reprent a tree, how should we represent a graph, a stack, a queue, a heap?  
3. It's fun!!!
