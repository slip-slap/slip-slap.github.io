#### what is a bivector ?
1. In mathematics, a bivector or 2-vector is a quantity in exterior algebra or
   geometric algebra that extends the idea of scalars and vectors.If scalar is
   considered an order zero quanity, and a vector is an order of one quantity,
   then a bivector can be thought of as being of order two.


2. Vector $\vec{a}$ is a directed line segment.
3. Bi-vector:
$
\vec{a} \vee \vec{b}
$ is a directed plane segment.

#### bivector application
Torque

#### AA
1. In affine geometry, there is no absolute area, it is just relative, it depends
on your measure system.
2. Ratios of areas are affine geometry invariants.

#### Volume
$$
\vec{a} v \vec{b} v \vec{c}=\left(a e_{1}+b e_{2}+c e_{3}\right) v\left(d
e_{1}+e e_{2}+f_{e}\right) v\left(g e_{1}+h e_{2}+i e_{3}\right)
$$

<br />
$$
\begin{aligned}=& a e i\left(e_{1} v e_{2} v e_{3}\right)+a f h\left(e_{1} v
e_{3} v e_{2}\right)+\\ & b d i\left(e_{2} v e_{1} v e_{3}\right)+b f
g\left(e_{2} v e_{3} v e_{1}\right)+\\ & c d h\left(e_{3} v e_{1} v
e_{2}\right)+c e g\left(e_{3} v e_{2} v e_{1}\right) \end{aligned}
$$

<br />
$$
=(a e i-a f h+b f g-b d i+c d h-c e g) e_{1} v e_{2} v e_{3}
$$

<br />

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\triangle(\vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c})=a e i-a f h+b f g-b d i+c
d h-c e g} \\ {\left(e, e_{2}, e_{3}\right)}\end{array}
$$

#### Definition
1. THE DOT OR SCLALAR PRODUCT: of two vectors $\textbf{A}$ and
   $\textbf{B}$, denoted by $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}$ (read $\textbf{A}$ dot
   $\textbf{B}$)$, 
-  is defined as the product of the magnitutes of $\textbf{A}$ and
   $\textbf{B}$ and the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between them. In symbols,
   
   $
   \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}=A B \cos \theta, \quad 0 \leqq \theta \leqq \pi
   $

2. THE CROSS OR VECTOR PRODUCT of $\textbf{A}$ and $\textbf{B}$ is a
   vector $
   \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}
   $ (read $\mathbf{A}$ cross $\mathbf{B}$). The magnitude of $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$
- is defined as the product of the magnitudes of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$
   and the sine of the angle $\theta$ between them. The direction of the vector 
   $
   \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}
   $ is perpendicular to the plane of $\textbf{A}$ and $\textbf{B}$ and such
   that $\textbf{A}$ ,$\textbf{B}$ and $\textbf{C}$ form a right-handed system.
   In symbols,
   $
   \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}=A B \sin \theta, \quad 0 \leqq \theta \leqq \pi
   $


#### Galois
1. We Calculate the cross product, it'a concept derive from the the bivector, a
   bivector represents the concept "area".
2. The inner product means vector length 
3. If we don't have background, it's difficult to tell the difference.
