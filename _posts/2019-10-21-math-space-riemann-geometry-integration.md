#### Introduction
Completion of our "lift" of analysis of chart to the manifold level. <br />
Our aim is, given a function, integrate on a manifold $$\int_{M}f$$ <br />



#### Definition 1: Volume Forms
On a smooth manifold,$$(M,O,\mathscr{A})$$, a (0,n-dim)-tensor field $$\Omega$$ is called **Volume Form**
