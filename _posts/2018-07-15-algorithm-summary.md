#### Introduction
Computer scientists are one of the most talented people in the world, they
create everything from scratch.
1.  At the beginning, they want to do something with a computer, they create a
    predefined procedure to let computer do the job.
2.  How to define the procedure? I think that's all the job algorithm should do
3.  and how, please look at the tools we have array
- array: 
- function: also this is what we created, just assume this is in our toolbox
4. just based on array and function, we create other tools linked, list, map,
   stack, heap, tree.
-  basically, all the fancy data structure is based on array and function.   
-  so how do they make it ?  they are many tricks there, but in a nutshell, all
   the tricks come in one way. 
-  **always associate array with pointers, sometimes, you need more than one
   ponters keep that in mind**


#### Problem Solution
1. Just like we solve math or phyics problems, we learn formula, principals, no
   matter what probem we meet, we stick with our formulas.
2. solving algorithm problem comes the same way, we know our tools, our strategy,
   based on our experience, we nail them.  
3. **Please always draw picture** 




#### terminology
1. key: in the context of data structure, a key is a value used to identify a
   certain component of a data structure.


#### Notation
$\leftarrow$ denotes assignment

```code
Algorithm Largest Number
    Input: a list of numbers
    Output: the largest number in the list

    if L.size = 0 return null
    largest ←  L(0)
    for each item in L, do
        if item > largest, then
            largest ←  item
return largest
```

#### Analyze
1. time 
2. space
3. power


#### Design
1. Optimization Problem
- greedy method
- dynamic programming
- branch and bound



#### Difference between Algorithm and Programming Language
1. design        implementation
2. any language  programming language
3. analyse       testing
4. Hardware Independent   hardware dependent

#### Galois
1. If you know Chinese, "树" means tree; If you know japanese,'き' means tree;
   If you can draw, probably you can draw a picture, and everyone knows it is a tree.
   but how could a computer knows a tree.
2. computer representation is very interesting, it's fun. Suppose the only two
   things we have is array and linked list, given these two things, How should
   we reprsent a tree, how should we represent a graph, a stack, a queue, a heap?  
3. It's fun!!!
4. The only thing that I learn from algorithm, draw picture, draw the procedure,
   it's better for everything.
