#### Platonic Solids
In three-dimensional space, a Platonic-solid is a regular, convex ployhedron. It
is constructed by congruent(identical in shape and size), regular(all angles 
equal and all sides equal), polygonal faces with the same number of
faces meeting at each vertex.

#### Polyhedron
Polyhedron: three-dimensional object made of polygonal faces, meeting along
edges or at a vertex.
