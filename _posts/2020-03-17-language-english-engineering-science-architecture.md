1. For a very long time, I just can't master english, in fact, I already spend a
   lot of time on it, but I can't talk with American native speaker

   of culture, custome, you have to follow the rule**, for example, basket,
   holder, container, can, tube, box are all used to describe specific object.
   If you misused them, it will cause confuse.
