#### Motivation
1. It origins from logic theory, logical connection
- The slogan of Saunders Mac Lane's book is **Adjont functors arise everywhere** 
- Adjunctions provide a more general language to describe a lot of
   constructions we've studied before.
- Understanding adjointness gives you a valuable addition to your mathematical
  toolkit. Most professional pure mathematicians know what categories and
  functos are, but far fewer know about adjoints. More should: adjoint functors
  are both common and easy, and knowing about adjoints helps you to spot
  patterns in the mathematical landscape.





#### Definition

$ F: \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{B} $ and $ G: \mathscr{B} \rightarrow
\mathscr{A} $
- F is said to be left adjoint to G.
- G is said to right adjoint to F.
