#### definition
A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length
and angle to be measured. Furthmore, Hilbert spaces are complete.


#### Separable Hilbert Space
From the separable metric space to separable Hilbert space.





#### terminology
1. injective: means we won't have two or more "A" pointing to the same "B", but we can have a "B" without a matching "A"
2. surjective: means every "B" has at least one matching "A". There won't a B left out.
3. bijective:  means both injective and surjective, so there is a perfect one-to-one correspondence between the members of the sets.
bijective function has an inverse.
4. onto: used as a function word to indicate a set each element of which is the **image** of at least one element of another set. \<a function mapping 
mapping the set S onto the set T\>
