#### Galois
1. For a long time, I have no idea what how does computer work. What the hell is
   a CPU ?  If you have any questions about anything, No back how fancy they
   look like ? Just go back to the history where it started. Figure about how
   everything evolved.
2. computer is supposed to do some computing work, anything else is build on
   this basic block, keep that in mind forever.
