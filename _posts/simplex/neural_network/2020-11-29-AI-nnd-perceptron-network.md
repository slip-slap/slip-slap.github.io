#### Background
In the late 1950s, Frank Rosenblatt and several other researchers developed a
class of neural networks called perceptrons.
- Drawback: the perceptron networks were incaplable of implementing certain
  elementary functions, these limitations were overcome with improved(multilayer)
  perceptron networks and associated learning rules.


#### Limitation
XOR problems are not linearly separable. 
- It was the inablility of the basic perceptron to solve such simple problems
  that led, to a reduction in interest in neural network research during the
  1970s
- Rosenblatt had investigated more complex networks, but he was never able to
  effectively extend the perceptron rule to such networks.

#### Galois
1. During the perceptrion learning process, our problem turn into the problem to
   find a decision boundary,
2. It can't solve linear unseparble problem, to the guy from Russia invented
   support vector machine.
