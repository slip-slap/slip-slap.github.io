1. set is the foundations of all the branches of modern mathmatics 
2. According to the function of math braches, math can be divided into four parts, structure, space, change, application, and discrete.


#### Difference between space and structure

1. $$R^N$$, Banach space, Normed vector space, Metric space, Hilbert space,
   Inner product space, vector space. modern mathematics uses many types of
   spaces.  it does not define the notion of "space" itself
2. Neither of these words space and structure have a single mathematical
   definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same
   situations, but you often think of a "space" as more geometric and a
   "structure as more algebraic. So you could thinke of "structures" as places
   we do algebra, and "spaces" we do geometry. 
3. The distinction between geometric "space" and algebraic "structure" is
   sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, groups are algebraic, while
   Euclidean spaces are geometric.


#### Greek Notation
1. $$ \xi \mapsto p_{\xi} $$: sign between $$\xi$$ and $$p_{\xi}$$ means maps to
2. $$\alpha$$ and A
3. $$\beta$$  and B
4. $$\gamma$$ and $$\Gamma$$
5. $$\delta$$ and $$\Delta$$
6. $$\epsilon$$ and $$\Epsilon$$
8. $$ \xi $$ and $$ \Xi $$ prounced |zai| in English, prounced |ksi| in modern
   Greek.
9. $$\sigma$$ and $$\Sigma$$
10. $$\phi$$ or $$\varphi$$  and  $$\Phi$$, these two letters are the same, but little change
11. $$\psi$$ and $$\Psi$$, usually stands for wave function in quanum mechanics.
12. $$\omega$$ and $$\Omega$$

####  brackets
1. curly brackets: {} which means the order doesn't matter
2. square brackets: [] the order matters

#### General Notation
1. $$\partial$$: denote as a partial derivative such as 
$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}
$$.
It represents a specialized cursive letter of d. It may simply pronounced simply "dee".

#### Reference
1. you often think space more geometric, such as metric space, Hilbert space,
   norm space. structure more algebraic, such as in group theory.
