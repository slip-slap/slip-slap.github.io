#### Structures
1. Package: on the top level you need to include the **tikz** package
2. Environments: In the main tex, each graphic needs to be put in a **tikzpicture** environment
3. Scopes: Inside these envrionments, you can use **scope** environments to create internal groups.
4. Styles: Inside the scopes you use **\path** commands to actually draw something.
