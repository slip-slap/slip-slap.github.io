#### Introduction
1. Mobius found projective geometry, homogeneous coordinate.
2. Mathematicans found that projective geometry maybe can used to study curves
   and surface, because there are infinity point in two dimensional and three
   dimensional space, and projective geometry can be used to study these
   properties.
3. These guys are not person, they are so clever.
4. The work of Mobius and Plucker gives us algebraci way to do that.


#### Homogeneous  Coordinate
1. Now we have projective geometry, it's just a plane with a point at infinity.
2. The problem is where is it, how can we see it,** we want to see it, touch
   it,and feel it, where is the point.**
3. The answer is homogeneous coordinate.

$$
\frac{Y}{Z} = (\frac{X}{Z})^2
$$

$YZ=X^2$ is homegeneous form for parabola. <br />
Now you have the homogeneous form what is the benefit of this form, can we say
the point at the infinity now ? **Yes, you can** <br />
Crap, these guys are so brilliant ! <br />
The infinity point is corresponding to $z=0$



#### conclusion
1. projectively, all conics look the same.

#### Topology in a projective way
Properties of stereographic projection.

1. P sends lines and circles in $A^2$ to circle on $S^2$
2. Lines on $A^2$ $$ \leftrightarrow $$ cricle on $S^2$ through S
3. p is conformal, conformal means  preserves angles and spreads


#### word
1. quadric: in mathmematics, a quadric or quadric surface is a generalization of conic sections(ellipses,
parabolas,and hyperbolas),it is a hypersuface(of dimension D) in a(D+1)-dimensional space.
2. foci: in geometry, focuses or foci, are special points with reference to which any of a variety
of curves is constructed.

#### Galios
we deal with projective geometry in homogeneous coordinate method, then we get
the infinity point. Given the infinity point, we can deal with a lot of things.
1. Laguerre use the inifity point to calculate the angle between any two lines.
2. Riemman deal with complex plane with infinity points.
3. Riemman always be able to see something in a very sightfull way, for example,
   Riemman integral, and now he come again, with a new way of dealing with
   curves.
