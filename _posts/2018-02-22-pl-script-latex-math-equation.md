#### Package amsmath

```latex
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
```
1. If using it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that only type 1 fonts
   will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option, it is possible that some math symbols,
   particularly those within footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
   document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!


#### Package mdwmath
1.  mdwmath.sty which is used to format equations
