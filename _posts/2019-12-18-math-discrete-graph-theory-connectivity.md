#### Concept 
1. A minimal connected graph: deleting any edge disconnects it
2. Cut Vertex: graph can be disconnected by the deletiong of one vertex, its cut
   vertex
3. Vertex Cut: A vertex cut of G is a subset $V^{\prime}$ of V such that $G-V^{\prime}$
is disconnected.
- A k-vertex cut is a vertex cut of k elements
- A complete graph has no vertex cut.
1. Block: A connected graph that has no cut vertices is called a block

#### Application: Construction of Reliable Communication Networks
