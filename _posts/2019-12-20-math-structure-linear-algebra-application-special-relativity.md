#### Introduction
1. The special theory of relativity is based on the work of
   J$\cdot$Maxwell,H$\cdot$Lorentz,H$\cdot$Poincare,H$\cdot$Minkowski.
2. The two postulates of Einstein: <br />
All inertial frames are equivalent with respect to the laws of physics. <br />
The speed of light is independent of the state of motion of its source. <br />
3. Conclusion based on two postulates.
time dilation, relativity of simultaneity, length contraction

#### Big Bang Theory
1. Define a milisecond, Does it make any sense if we don't have any clock ? 
2. The usual presentation of Big Bang that we see in the popular press are
   highly suspect from anyone with a logical skeptical point of view.
3. SR is a logical consequence of Newtonian mechanics, and could have been
   discovered by any time after 1700.
