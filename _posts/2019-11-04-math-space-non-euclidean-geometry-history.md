#### HAHA
1. Gauss is the first guy who finds Non-Euclidean Geometry, but he keep this to himself, never told
anybody. you may say he is perfectism, but maybe he just selfish. Later on, another Russian guy 
find Non-Euclidean geometry, to study his paper, Gauss learn Russian language.
2. Bolyai find Non-euclidean geometry, and pushished it. and send the paper to Gauss, but gauss 
ignore said I had alread find this. So his work is ignored by contempory scitentist.
