#### Definition
1. Trellis: A trellis is a graph consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are
   grouped into vertical slices called times, and the times are ordered such
   that each edge connects a node in one time to a node in a neighbouring time.
   Every edge is labelled with a symbol.
   - The leftmost and rightmost states contain only one node. Apart from these
     two extreme nodes, all nodes in the trellis have at least one edge
     connecting leftwards and at least one connecting rightwards.
