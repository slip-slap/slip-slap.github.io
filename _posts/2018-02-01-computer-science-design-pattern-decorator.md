#### Background
The decorator pattern is a structural pattern that lets you attach additional
functionalities to an object dynamically. In other words, the client has the
freedom to create an object and then extend it by adding a variety of "features"
to it
- A good analogy to simplify this pattern is: "wrapping a gift, putting it in a
  box, and wrapping the box"
- The decorator pattern is classified among structural design patterns which are
  all about class and object composition.
- Structural object-patterns defien ways to compose objects to obtain new
  functionality.



#### Keywords
1. Flexibility: we want to give to the client the power and flexibility to
   dynamically add any feature to a component/object, that could be considered
   valuable

2. Extend functionality: the title may be a little bit misleading, this pattern
   is not only about "decorating" a certain object, but it is mainly about
   extending its functionality.
