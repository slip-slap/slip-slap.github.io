#### Delta Operator and Gradient
$$
\nabla f=\left\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial x} f, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}
f, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} f\right\rangle
$$

#### Example of Vector and Covector
1. $\nabla {f}$ obtains a vector
2. $df$  obtains a covector
- For a very very long time, I just can't understand why $df$ is a covector,
  because as soon as I see the sign $df$, the expression such as $$3dx+5dy+6dz$$
  come into my mind, that's the form of $$df$$, that's calculation process of
  $df$, you should focus on the result of the $df$, it's just a number.
