#### Definition Cross-ration: the cross-ratio of aquadruple of distince points
on the real line with coordiantes $z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$ is given by:

$$ ($z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4$)=\frac{(z_3-z_1)(z_4-z_2)}{(z_3-z_2)(z_4-z_1)} $$

#### HAHA
Cayley: All geometry are projective geometry



#### How to deal with projective geometry in a algbraic way?

#### Solution: Homogeneous Coordinates
1. Homogeneous coordinates: make calculations of graphics and geometry possible
   in projective.
2. Homogeneous coordinates are a way of representing N-dimensional coordinates
   with N+1 numbers.

#### why is it called "homogeneous"
points(1,2,3),(2,4,6) and (4,8,12) correspond to the same Euclidean point
(1/3,2/3). And any scalar product,(1a,2a,3a) is the same point as (1/3,2/3) in
Euclidean space. Therefore, these points are **homogeneous** because they
represent the same point in Euclidean space. In other words, Homogeneous
coordinates are scale invariant.


#### Galois
1. Given the Euclidean geometry, we have Descartes Coordinates to do geometry
   algebraicly, angle, distance, intersection point. 
2. Given affine geometry, we have coordinate of vector to do geometry
   algebraicly.
3. Given projective geometry, how we deal with this geometry in a algebraic way,
   the answer is homogeneous coordinate.
