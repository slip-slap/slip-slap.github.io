#### Introduction
1. Closed surfaces are divided into two classes, orientable and non-orientable.
- The sphere and the torus are examples of orientable surfaces;   
- The projective plane and the Mobius band are non-orientable.

#### HAHA
A surface M is orientable which means we can consistenly assign a notion of
positive rotation as we move around.

#### Mobius Band
Mobius band is non-orientable.
