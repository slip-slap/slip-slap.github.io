#### Extended Real Number System
The extended real number system $R^\asterisk$ is the real line $R$ with two
additional elements attached, called $+\infty$ and $-\infty$. 
- These elements are distinct from each other, and also distinct from every real
  number.
- An extended real number is $x$ is called finite iff it is a real numer, and
  infinite iff it is equal to  $+\infty$ or $-\infty$.
- These new symbols $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, at present do not have much meaning,
  since we have no operations to manipulate them.



#### Galois
1. we define $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, but there are only limit operations on
   these two elements. 
2. Our knowledge is so limited.
