####
1. composite laminates
2. laminated composite plate
3. laminated composite


####
1. laminate is only subject to in-plane loading and it is symmetric, curvature
   terms become zero.
2. for the same reason, the mechanical response of the laminate is independent
   of the stacking sequence.



#### 
1. The validity and applicability of a given failure criterion depend on the
   convenience of application and agreement with reliable experimental data.
