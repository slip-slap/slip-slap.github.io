#### What is C++ ?
1. Direct map to hardware
- of instructions and fundamental data types
- initially from c
2. Zero-overhead abstraction
- classes with constructors and destructors, inheritance, generic programming,
  functional programming techniques
- initially from Simula

2. Much of the inspiration came from operating system

#### The Future of C++
1. Better at it for modern hardware and techniques.
2. Compatibility/stability is a feature. 


#### Key Strengths:
1. Software infrastructure
2. resource-constrained applications
