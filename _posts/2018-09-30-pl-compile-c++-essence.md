#### What is C++ ?
1. Direct map to hardware
- of instructions and fundamental data types
- initially from c
2. Zero-overhead abstraction
- classes with constructors and destructors, inheritance, generic programming,
  functional programming techniques
- initially from Simula

3. Much of the inspiration came from operating system

#### The Future of C++
1. Better at it for modern hardware and techniques.
2. Compatibility/stability is a feature. 


#### Key Strengths:
1. Software infrastructure
2. resource-constrained applications


#### Galois
1. C++ is a beast, it has two many features Macro, OOP, GP. It doesn't mean we
   have to use them. Why C++ is so flexible, because it has two stages,
   compile,liner. During the two stages, you can do a lot staff, acutally many
   fancy grammer exists, just because the two stages.
2. The first thing that differentiate from any othe language is mapping
   operationg to hardware, the second is zero-overhead
3. If C++ want to continue its advantage in programming language, it must adapt
   to new hardware, and make use of them.
