#### Definition
We can express any finite abelian group as a finite direct product of cyclic
groups. More specifically, letting  $p$ be prime, we define a group G to be
$p-group$ if every element in G has its order a power of p
- For example, both $\mathbf{Z}_2$ and $\mathbf{Z}_2$ and $\mathbf{Z}_4$ are
  2-groups, where $\mathbf{Z}_{27}$ is a 3-group.
- Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic
  p-groups
