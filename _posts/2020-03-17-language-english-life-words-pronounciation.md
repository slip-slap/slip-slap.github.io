#### p
1. export
- this is a simple word, but for the moment I just realize how to pronounce it.
the alphabet "x" has two sounds "k" and "s". "k" should be read out in a light
voice, but "x" should be amphasised.
2. expire
2. indispensable
3. independent

#### mb
1. tomb

#### ct
1. electric

####
1. compensation
2. activation 


#### galois
1. maybe the most important thing for pronounciation is find out where to
   emphasis.
