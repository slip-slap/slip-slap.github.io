#### A decision-making situation D
1. a set of outcomes $$ \mathcal{O}=\left\{o_{1}, \ldots, o_{N}\right\} $$
2. a set of possible actions that the agent can take, $$
   \mathcal{A}=\left\{a_{1}, \dots, a_{K}\right\} $$
3. A probabilistic outcome model $$ P: \mathcal{A} \mapsto \Delta_{\mathcal{O}}
   $$, which defines a lottery $\pi_{\alpa}$, which specifies a probability
   distribution over outcomes given that the action was taken.
4. a utility function $$
U: \mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathbb{R}
$$, where $U(o)$ is the agent's preferences for the outcome $o$.
