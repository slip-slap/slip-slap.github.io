#### Introduction
1. Probability is the science of uncertainty. It provides precise mathematical
   rules for understanding and analyzing our own ignorance.

#### Probability model
**A probability model** consists of a nonempty set called the sample space
**S**; a collection of events that are subsets of **S**; and a probability
measure **P** assigning a probability between 0 and 1 to each event. 

1. **Sample Space**: A sample space is any set that lists all possible outcomes(or, responses) of
   some unknown experiment or situation.
2. **Probability Measure**: usually written P. This probability measure must
   assign, to each event A, a probability P(A).
3. $A^c$: if A is any event, we write $A^c$(read "A complement") for the event
   that A does not occur.
   $$
   P(A^c)=1-P(A)
   $$



#### Galois
1. To study geometry, we introduce calculus, and now, to study probability, we
   also need to use calculus, calculus just a tool can be used in geometry and
   probability.
2. The true logic for this world is the **calculus of probabilities**, which takes
   account of the magnitude of the probability which is, or ought to be, in a
   reasonable man's mind (Maxwell 1950)
