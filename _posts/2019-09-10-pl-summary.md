#### Why we have this?
For a new code library is just a bundle of functions and classes. <br />
1. find the offical website about this package.
2. There is always a very mature document comes along with this a package.
3. In the document, you can find code demo about how to use this package.


#### Common Short
1. LHS: left-hand side
2. RHS: right-hand side

#### Programming Style

##### Imperatives-style VS Symbolic-style 
1. Imperative-style programs perform computation as you run them.
2. Symbolic Programs


##### Deep Learning Library and Programming Style
1. Symbolic style deep learning library include Tensorflow, Theano
2. Imperative stype deep learning library include Torch 

#### Error
1. Every programming language has its features, things are different, not every
   error goes to the same way. 

##### Latex
##### script
