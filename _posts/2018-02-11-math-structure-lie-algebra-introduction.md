#### Inspiration
1. Galois(1811-1832) had used group theory to solve algebraic (polynomial)
equations that were quadratic, cubic, and quartic.
- He was able to prove that no closed form solution could be constructed for the
  general quintic(or any higher degree) equation using only the four standard
  operations of arithmetic as well as extraction of the nth roots of a complex
  number
2. Lie initiated his program on the basis of analogy. If finite groups were
   required to decide on the solvability of finite-degree polynomial equations,
   then 'infinite groups' would probably be involved in the treatment of
   ordinary and partial differential invariance.
- Further, Lie knew that the structure of the polynomial's invariance group not
  only determined whether the equation was solvable in closed form, but also
  provided the algorithm for constructing the solution in the case that the
  equation was solvable
- He therefore felt that the structure of an ordinary differential equation's
  invariance group would determine whether or not the equation could be solved
  or simplified and, if so, the group's structure would also provide the
  algorithem for constructing the solution or simplification.




#### Galois
1. Lie group is a geometry object, like a curve.
- how we study a curve, we obtain it's derivative function, if we know it's
  derivative function, we know this curve.
2. Lie group is this special geometry object, and lie algebra is it's
   derviative.
3. The Lie algebra is an indispensable tool for studying a matrix group. It
   contains a surprising amount of information about the group, especially
   together with the Lie bracket operation.
4. Why this name? It must mean something.
- Why it's called Lie Algebra, it's an analogue.
- Because Lie group is an geometry object, we put something on this, we refer it
  as Lie algebra.
- Just like vector space, we put algebra on it. we call it linear algebra.
