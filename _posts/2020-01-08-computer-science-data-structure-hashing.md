#### Why this crap ?
1. we have linear search, its time complexity is $\Theta (n)$
2. we have binary search, its time complexity is $log_2^n$
3. The problem is: we need more, we don't satisify with the current situation,
   we need more, how about constant time, can we do it? give it a shot.
4. The solution is **hashing** !!! Just constant time, are you excited ? let's
   began our journey.

####
1. simple uniform hashing


#### 
1. Expected length of chain for k keys, m slots:  n over m, called $\alpha$, the
   load factor of the table.
