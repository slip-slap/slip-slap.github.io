#### What is string?
String just array, everymethod you learn in array. You can apply them in string. 

#### A
1. basically, compuer doesn't support characters
2. we define some set of numbers as characters.
3. ASCII codes for English, Unicodes for all language.





#### Galois
1. String is one of the abstract data type, this is amazing! I just too familiar
   with string, so I forgot what it is in nature.
2. There is no string in the computer, but in life we need use it. So we create
   this ADT, just like stack, queue, and the other things.
