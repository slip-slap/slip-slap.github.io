#### Introduction
1. In mathematics, the **special unitary group** of degree n, denoted SU(n), is the
Lie Group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices with determinant 1. 
- More general unitary matrices may have complex determinants with absolute
   value 1, rather then real 1 in the special case.
- After the first sight of unitary, I am kind of scared, but actually, it is
  very simple, just the abstract of "Unit one", because not sure about the unit,
  just create the word "unitary"
