#### 
1. generate state space tree: this is the first step. 
2. bounding function: optimize this function.

#### solution






#### Application
1. N Queen Problem
2. Sum of Subsets Problem


#### Difference Between Backtracking and Dynamic Programming
1. both of them are brue force
2. Dynamic programming is used for optimization problem, find the best optimal
3. Backtracking is used to find all the solution
