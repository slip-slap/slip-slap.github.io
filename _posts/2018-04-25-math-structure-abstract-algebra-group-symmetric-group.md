### Symmetric groups

#### Notation
1. $S_n$: Group of permutations on a set with n elements. 
- $S_3$: group of puermutations on a set with 3 elements, and it has $3!$ elements
- $S_4$: permutations of ${1,2,3,4}$, and it has $4!$ elements



#### What good will this do me?
1. Every finite group is a subgroup of symmetric group.


### Alternating groups

#### Definition
1. Alternating groups: One of the most important subgroups of $S_n$ is the set of all even
permutations, $A_n$. The group $A_n$ is called the $\textbf{alternating group on}$ 
n $\textbf{letters}$.


#### Theorem
1. The set $A_n$ is a subgroup of $S_n$
2. The number of even permutations in $S_n$, $n \geq 2 $, is equal to the
   number of odd permuations; hence the order of $A_n$ is $\frac{n!}{2}$

### Dihedral groups
1. Another special type of permutation group is the dihedral group.
