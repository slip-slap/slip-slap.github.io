#### 1. Definition
A linker is a computer program that takes one or more object files generated by
a compiler and combines them into one, executable program.

1. Linking has nothing to do with C or C++ specifically: compilers just generate the object files.
   the linker then takes them as input without ever knowing what language compiled them. It might as
   well be Fortran.


#### 2. Error
```cpp
#include<iostream>
void my_tool();
int main()
{
	my_tool();
	std::cout<<"hello world!";
}


```



```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "my_tool()", referenced from:
      _main in work-3e80d8.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```


#### 3. Static library and dynamic library
1. static library means this file will go into your executable file.
2. Dynamic means link the library on the fly.
-  this is just the package in python, or java.
- Each C++ libary provides two files, the includes for compiler.
- The library for the linker.
- Why c++ doesn't  have a package manager, because developers don't buy this.
