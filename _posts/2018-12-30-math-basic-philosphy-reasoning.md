#### Background
Aristotle said:"the man is rational animal."

#### Species of Argument
Deductive, inductive, abductive, argument by analogy, 


#### terminology
1. Induction: using past experience to make future predictions.
- Because aspirin can cure most people's headache according to your expericence,
  you believe it cure your headache too.
- Premise 1: Most men in ancient Athens had beards
- Premise 2: Socrates was a man who lived in ancient Athens
- Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates probably had a beard.

2. Abduction: Drawing a conclusion based on the explanation that best explains a
   state of events, rather than from evidence provided by the premises.
- Anna told you she failed her physics midterm
- Anna hasn't been in physics class since you teacher graded the exams
- Anna has been in sociology class. which meets right after physics.
- Conclusion: Anna dropped physics(we can't get this conclusion by induction or
  deduction, but the conclusion can explain the event very well.)

3. Deduction:
- Premise: every cat has four claws.
- Evidence: Tom is a cat.
- Conclusion: Tom has four claws.




#### Galois
1. Philosphers believed the world is built based on some essential building
   blocks. For example, the classic elements are water, fire.
2. So in real analysis, we believe the number system is built based on zero and
   increment operation.
