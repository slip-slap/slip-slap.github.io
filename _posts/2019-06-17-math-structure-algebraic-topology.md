#### Algebraic Topology
1. The study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by the
   continuous change of shape or size of figures.
2. Algebraic means use algebraic to study topology.
3. we are not asking the distance, what are the essential features of these
   mathematic objects which are invarient under the continuous deformation.
4. Through this course, we are going to have a good look at some objects which
   are realy centeral  in mathmatics.
5. you are going to learn fundamental objects.

#### four dimensional space we can't image four dimensional space.but
1. in zero-dimensional space, it's a point
2. in one-dimensional space, we cut along a point, the intersection  is a
   zero-dimensional space.
3. in two-dimensional space, we cut along a line,  the intersection is a
   one-dimensional space.
4. in three-dimensional space, we cut along a random plane, the intersection is
   a two-dimensional space.


#### Winding Numbers #### Euler Numbers

#### remark why we often use manifold, such as sphere, torus, because they are
more fundamental objects, they are objects can be treated almost the same as
them.
1. torus is a fundamental object in mathematics.


#### One-dimensional Objects
The space of all 1-dim subspace

#### Concept: Group Structure on a Circle
1. This is found by an India high school teacher, the level of India high school
   teacher, at least, some of them is very high.
2. This concept is pure geometry, and you can prove it with algebraic geometry,
   I think that's why mathematian don't believe algebraic in geometry.

#### Construction of Toplogical Space
Affine Plane($A^2$) is  <br />
$$
A^2 \simeq A^1 \times A^1
$$
This formula means take order pairs.

#### Remark
Product of space, $X \times Y$: [x,y] which x from X, y from Y.


#### Galois
1. Why we study manifold ? what is a manifold ? what can we do with manifold ?
2. Im my opinion, manifold is just a generalization of geometry object, the benefit
of this generalization is we can find some intrinsic feature of some geometry,
we can classification.
3. For example, Euler characteristic can be generailzed by a sphere, that's the
   power of generaization of the concept of geometry.
4. In my opinion, topology is toplogy, how can we connect this to algebra.
   That's impossible, but, but, but, There is an always amazning guy. He use
   group theory to connect the algebra and topology, That's unbelievable.

5. There is a very important properties in topology, which is isomorphism,
   **why,why,why isomorphism is so important**, just because, by isomorphism, we
   can keep the intrinsic properties of target, and this provides us more efficient
   way to solve problems. For example, the polynomial space is isomorphic to
   vector space, and we can study polynomial space problems by study vector
   space.
