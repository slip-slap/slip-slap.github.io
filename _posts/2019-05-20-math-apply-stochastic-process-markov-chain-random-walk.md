+ Markov Chain is just a fancy term for a random walk on a graph
+ what it says it that for a very long walk, the probability that you end at
  some vertex *V* is independent of where you started

#### definition
Ergodic Markov Chains: A Markov Chain is ergodic if there is a positive probability to pass from any state to any other states in one step.



#### Galois
1. The role of Markov Chain in stochastic process is similar to the Newton's Law in Physics.
2. Both of them predict the future based on the current state.
