#### Problem
1. minimize  $C^Tx$
- subject to $a_i^T \leq b_i, i=1,\cdots,m$

1. the objective and all constraint functions are linear
2. no analytical formula for solution, reliable and efficient algorithms and
   software.
- establish **rigorous bounds** on the number of operations required to solve a linear program
- simplex method
- interior-point method
