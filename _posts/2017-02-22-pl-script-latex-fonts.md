#### Category
Typefaces can be divided into three cateogories: serif, sans serif, monospaced.

#### Serif
Serif is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger
stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font of family of fonts.


1. In the Chinese and Japanese writing systems, there are common type styles
  based on the regular script for Chinese characters akin to serif and sans
  serif.
2. In Mainland China, the most popular category of serifed-like typefaces is
   called Song(宋体); Black(黑体) is sans serif-like.
3. Times New Roman is a serif typeface.

#### Sans serif
Sans serif is one that does not have extending features called "serif" at the
end of strokes. Sans-serif fonts tend to have less stroke width variation than
serif fonts. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or
minimalism.

#### Monospaced
Monospaced type is the one that its letters and characters each occupy the same
amount of horizontal space. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the
letters and spacings have different widths.
