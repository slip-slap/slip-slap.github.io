#### definition
Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and
related theories, such as differentiation, integration, infinite series. <br />
Analysis evolved from calculus, which involves the elementary concepts and
techniques of analysis. Analysis may be distinguished from geometry; howerver,
it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of
nearness(a topological space) or specific distances between objects (a metric
space).

#### sign
1. $ \forall $ means for all  For examle:$ \forall n \in \mathbb{N} : n^{2}
   \geq n $
2. $ \exists $ means there exists For example: $\exists n \in \mathrm{N} : n
   \text { is even } $
3. $ \Leftrightarrow $ means the same as For example: $ x+5=y+2
   \Leftrightarrow x+3=y $

#### problem with differential
$d(xy)=xdy+ydx$

$
(x+dx)(y+dy)-xy=xdy+ydx+dxdy
$ 
1. Leibniz think $dxdy$ are too small, you can get rid of them. 
2. at that time the concept of "limit" havn't appear. Newton has the same idea.
3. As far as I am concerned, if you get rid of something, such as $dxdy$, and
   they are not equal zero, the result will not be accurate.
4. but the fact is opposite, it is **accurate**, although, there are some flaw
   with this theorem. The result is **accurate!!!**


#### What does arithmetical consist of ?
Addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and take roots <br />
J$\cdot$Gregory thinks that limit operation is also an arithmetical operation.
