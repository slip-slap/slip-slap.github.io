#### Relationship Between Machine Learning and Information Theory
1. Human Brain is amazing, it can memorize and do the inference, but how ? we
   want to know
2. We are interested in do the inference based on known information, that's the
   job of machine learning. **one problem** is how the data should be feed into
   neural network, in what kind? That's the job of information theory.
3. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems.
