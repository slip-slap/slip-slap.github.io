#### Background
It is a familiar fact from vector calculus that line and surface integrals
depend on the orientaion of the curve or surface over which the integration
takes place: 
- reversing the orientation changes the sign of the integral
- the goal of this section is to define orientation for n-dimensional manifolds
  and to investigate various equivalent characterizations of orientation.
