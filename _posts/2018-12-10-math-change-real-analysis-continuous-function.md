#### Definition
1. $\epsilon$-adherent points. Let $X$ be a subset of $R$, let $\epsilon>0$, and
   let $x \in R$. We say that x is $\epsilon-adherent$ to $X$ iff there exists a
   $y \in X$ which is $\epsilon-close$ to x

2. Adherent points. Let $X$ be a subset of $R$, and let $x\in R$, we say that x
   is an adheren point of X iff it is $\epsilon-adherent$ to $X$ for every
   $\epsilon > 0$
3. Limit Points: Let $X$ be a subset of the real line. We say that x is a limit
   point(or a cluster point)  of $X$ iff it is an adherent poin of X\\{x}. We
   say that x is an isolated point of $X$ if $x \in X$ and there exists some $
   epsilon > 0$ such that $|x-y|>\epsilon$ for all $y \in$ X \\{x}
- remark: It turns out that the set of adherent points splits into the set of
  limit points and the set of isolated points.

#### Galois
1. Sometimes, we think we are so smart, we can nail any problems, actually, we
   can't, we only know very little about the world. 
2. continuous functions are the only function that we know, we can study, so
   many problem are unsolved.
