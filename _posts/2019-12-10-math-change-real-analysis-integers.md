#### Inspiration
1. We can characterize equality of differences using only the concept of addition
- so we will take advantage of our foreknowledge by building all this into the
  definition of the integers

2. we will temporarily write integers not as a difference $a-b$, but instead use
   a new notation $a--b$ to define integers
- $--$ is a meaningless place-holder, similar to the comma in the Cartesian
  co-ordinate notation $(x,y)$ for points in the plane.
- Later when we define substraction we will see that $a--b$ is in fact equal to
  $a-b$, and so we can discard the notation $--$
- These devices are similar to the scaffolding used to construct a building;
  they are temporarily essential to make sure the building is build correctly,
  but onc the building is completed they are thrown away and never used again.
