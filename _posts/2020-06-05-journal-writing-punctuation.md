#### 1. comma 
#####  before which 
Place a comma before which when which precedes a nonrestrictive clause
- A nonrestictive clause is a phrase that adds non-essential inforation to a
  sentence without changing the overall meaning.

#### 2. semicolon
The semicolon looks like a comma with a period above it, and this can be a good way to remember what it does.
**A semicolon creates more separation between thoughs than a comma does but less than a period does.**

1. a semicolon is most commonly used to link to independent clauses that are
   closely related in thought.
- some people write with a word processor; others write with a pen or pencil.

2. use semicolon between items in a list or series if any of them contain commas.
- There are basically two ways to write: with a pen or pencil, which is
  inexpensive and easilly accessible; with a computer, which is expensive but
  quick and neat.


#### 3. Colon
Colons follow independent clauses(clauses that could stand alone as sentences)
and can be used to present an explanation, draw attention to something, or join
ideas together.

##### Common mistakes
1. Using a colon between a verb and its object or complement.
- The very best peaches: are those that are grown in the great state of Georgia(incorrect).
- Drop the colon
2. Using a colon between a preposition and its object.
- My favourite cake is make of: carrots, flour, butter, eggs, and cream cheese icing.
- drop the colon
3. Using a colon after "such as", "including", "especially" and similar
   phrases. This violates the rule that the material preceding the colon mest be a complete thought
- There are many different types of paper, including: college ruled, wide ruled, and plain copy paper.

##### How to check
Ask yourself a question: does the material preceding the colon stand on its
own? If not, you may be using the colon improperly.
