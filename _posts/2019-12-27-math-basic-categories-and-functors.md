#### Background
Many of the problems in mathematics share common features. For example, in
topology one is interested in knowing whether two topological spaces are
hommeomorphic and in group theory one is interested in knowing whether two
groups are isomorphic. This has given rise to the theory of categories and
functors.


#### With Algebraic Topology
Much of algebraic topology is the study of functors, for example, the homology,
cohomology, and homotopy functors. For a functor to be truly useful, it should
be simple enough to be computable, ye complex enough to preserve essential
features of the original category.

#### With Smooth Manifold
Tangent bundle the differential forms, culminating in de Rham cohomology are
functors of smooth manifolds.
