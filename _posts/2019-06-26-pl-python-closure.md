#### Why Closures?
All the crap comes out because of the concept of non-local variable. First let's define some concept.
1. nested funciton: A function defined inside another function is called nested function.


#### The Criteria of a Closure
1. it must have a nested function (function inside a function)
2. The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function
3. The enclosing function must return the nested function.
