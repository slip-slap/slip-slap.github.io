#### Motivation
The ultimate goal of group theory is to classify all groups up to isomorphism;
that is, given a particular group, we should be able to match it up with a known
group via an isomorphism.
- For example, we have already proved that any finite cyclic group of order n is
  isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}_n$
- Hence, we "know" all finite cyclic groups. It is probably not reasonable to
  expect that we will ever know all groups;
- However, we can often classify certain types of groups or distinguish between
  groups in special cases.
