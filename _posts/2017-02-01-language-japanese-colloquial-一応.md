#### Basic
not perfectly, completely but to some extent, sort of 
- japanese people like to use ambiguous expression lesson. You should also remember to try to make
  youself sound modest.


1. ぺらぺらです
2. まだまだです
3. 一応ちょっとできます(I can sort of speak it, it means "not fully", but "to some extent")

#### For bragging
The second example may sound more humble because 一応 has a connotations of "somehow", but a lot of
time, you are actually emphasing the fact that you are a collage graduate. This way the listener
will think you are proud of being a collage graduate.

So 一応 was originally used to make yourself sound humble or subtle, but since it focuses the fact
more, it actually gives people around you the impression that you are bragging.
1. 私は大学を出ている
2. 私は一応大学を出ている
3. これでも一応、結婚しているので(I may not look I am married but) I am married
