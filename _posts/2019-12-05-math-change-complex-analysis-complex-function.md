#### definition
1. complex function: a function takes a complex argument and yields a complex result,In other words, it is a function that has a suset of the complex.
numbers as a domain and the complex numbers as a codomain.
2. The derivative of complex function is different from the derivative of real variable function in nature.
3. As a differentiable function of a complex variable is equal to its Taylor series, complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions
of a complex variable, that is holomorphic function. <br />
holomorphic means: complex continuous differentiable


#### Analytic Functions of a Complex Variable
A function $$f(z)$$ is said to be analytic in a region R of the complex plane if $$f(z)$$ has a derivative at each point of R and if f(z) is single valued.


#### Holomorphic functions
$$
f^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)=\lim _{z \rightarrow z_{0}} \frac{f(z)-f\left(z_{0}\right)}{z-z_{0}}, \quad z \in \mathbb{C}
$$

Complex functions that are differentiable at every point of an open subset $$\Omega$$ of the complex plane are said to be holomorphic on $$\Omega$$.

#### Riemann surface
In complex analysis, A Riemann surface is a one-dimensional complex manifold. Riemann surfaces can be thought as "deformed versions" of the complex 
plane, locally near every point they look like pathes of the complex plane, but the global topology can be quite different. For example, they can look
like a sphere or a torus or a couple of sheets glued together. <br />

basically, a Riemann surface is simply just a surface, as far as the shape is concerned. Any normal surface you can think of, For example, plane, sphere,
torus are all Riemann surfaces. we say it's Riemann surface, is due to the context, is that we define the surface using complex functions, and for use in 
studying complex functions.
