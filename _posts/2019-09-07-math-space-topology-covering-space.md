#### What is covering space?
1. Here comes new terminology "covering space", so what is be covered by the
   covering space?
2. The answer is base.




#### HAHA
$A^{2}=A^{\prime} \times A^{\prime}$$ <br />
Product of lines: this is a construction of topological spaces.



#### Borromean Rings 
In mathematics, the Borromean rings consist of three topological circles which
are linked but where removing any one ring leaves the other two unconnected. In
other words, no two of the three rings are linked with each other as a Hopf
link, but nonetheless all three are linked.

#### Definition
Genus: A topologically invariant property of a surface defined as the largest
number of nonintersecting simple closed curves that can be drawn on the surface
without separating it. Roughly speaking, it is the number of holes in a surface.
-  It can be described by the number of the holes, it's a little bit
informal, more careful definition, the maximum number of disjoint loops on the
surface. <br />
