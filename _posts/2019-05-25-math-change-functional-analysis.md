#### Introduction
Mathematicians are lazy, much like programmers are lazy. They want to abstract
everything so that a statement can be made to apply to as many things as
possible. <br /> For example, In software, there is the idea of a base class
that abstracts away characteristics of many different classes. So we can have
Fruit, Apple, and Orange with Fruit being the base. <br /> definition:
Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is
formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related
structure(e.g. inner product, norm, topology)

#### Research object
The elemnt in a space maybe function, or operator, such as integral,
differentiate, series
 

#### History
The usage of the word **functional** as a noun goes back to the calculus of
variations, implying a function whose argument is a function


#### Abbreviation
sup: short for supremum, the supremum of a subset S of a partially ordered set T
is the least element in T that is greater than or equal to all elements of S, if
such an element exists.  inf: short for infimum, the infimum of a subset of a
partially ordered set T is the greatest element in T that is less than or equal
to all elements of S, if such an element exists.
