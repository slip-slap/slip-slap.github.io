#### C
1. Theorem: Assume that $\{Z_n; n\geq 1\}$ converges to $\alpha$ WP1 and assume
   that f(x) is areal valued function of a real variable that is continuous at
   $x=\infty$. Then $x=\alpha$. Then $\{f(Z_n);n\geq 1\}$ converges WP1 to
   $f(\alpha)$
- Random Variables are far more complicated things, because of that they have more
ways that they can approach limits.
