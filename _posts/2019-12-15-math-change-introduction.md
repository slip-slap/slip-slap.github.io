#### definition
Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and
related theories, such as differentiation, integration, infinite series. <br />
Analysis evolved from calculus, which involves the elementary concepts and
techniques of analysis. Analysis may be distinguished from geometry; howerver,
it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of
nearness(a topological space) or specific distances between objects (a metric
space).

#### sign
1. $$ \forall $$ means for all  For examle:$$ \forall n \in \mathbb{N} : n^{2}
   \geq n $$
2. $$ \exists $$ means there exists For example: $$\exists n \in \mathrm{N} : n
   \text { is even } $$
3. $$ \Leftrightarrow $$ means the same as For example: $$ x+5=y+2
   \Leftrightarrow x+3=y $$
