#### Concept
1. A k-vertex colouring of G is an assignment of k colours, $1,2,\cdots,k$ to
   the vertices of G;
- The colouring is proper if no two distince adjacent vertices have the same
  colour.
2. chromatic number: $$ \chi(G)$$, of G is the minimum k for which G is
   k-colourable; 
- if $$\chi(G)=k$$, G is said to be k-chromatic.

3. Girth: the girth of G is the length of a shortest cycle in G; if G has no
   cycles we define the girth of G to be infinite.
