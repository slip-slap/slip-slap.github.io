#### Background
1. Abstract Lie algebras are algebraic structures used in the Lie groups.
2. They are vector space endomorphisms of linear transformations that have a new
   operation that is neither associatve nor commutative, but referred to as the
   bracket operation, or commutator.



#### Definition
1. A finite-dimensional real or complex Lie Algebra is a finite-dimensional real
   or complex vector space $ \mathfrak{g} $, together with a map $
   [\cdot, \cdot] \text { from } \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g}
   $ into $ \mathfrak{g} $, with the following properties:
- $[\cdot, \cdot]$ is bilinear.
- $[\cdot, \cdot]$ is skew symmetris: [X,Y] = -[Y,X] for all $X,Y \in \mathfrak{g}$ 
- The Jacobi identity holds: 
$
[X,[Y, Z]]+[Y,[Z, X]]+[Z,[X, Y]]=0
$
for all $X,Y, Z \in \mathfrak{g}$
