#### classification
1. Ordinary Differential Equation(O.D.E.)
2. Partile Differential Equation(P.D.E)
3. order: the number of highest derivative in a differential equation. 

$
y^{\prime \prime}+x y^{\prime}-x^{3} y=\sin x
$
is second order since the highest derivative is $$y^{\prime \prime}$$ is the second derivative.
4. degree: In mathematics, the degree of a differential equation is the power of its highest derivative.


#### terminology
1. trivial solution: a solution or example that is riduculously simple and of little interest. Often solutions or examples involving the number
0 are considered trivial. Nonzero solution or examples are considered nontrivial.
For example:
$
x+5 y=0
$
has the trivial solution x=0, y=0. Nontrivial solutions include x=5, y=-1
2. particular solution:


#### classification
1. homogenous differential equation: a differential equation is homogeneous when it can be this form:
$
\frac{d y}{d x}=F\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$


#### Galois
1. When we learn differential equation, we should focus on numberical
   solution, instead of analytical solution
2. Because all the possible analytical solution has been find, but with computer
   software, we can find any numberical solution.
