#### Concept
1. Factor Marginalization: Let X be a set of variables, and Y $\in X$ a
   variable. Let $\phi(X,Y)$ be a factor. We define the factor marginalization
   of Y in $\phi$, denoted by $\sum_Y \phi$, to be a factor $\psi$ over X such
   that: <br />
$$
\psi(\boldsymbol{X})=\sum_{Y} \phi(\boldsymbol{X}, Y)
$$
