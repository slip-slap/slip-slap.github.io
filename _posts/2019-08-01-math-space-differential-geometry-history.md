#### History
1. differential geometry: is calculus and analytic geometry applied to curves and surfaces. 
2. Curvature: the key concept through differential geometry, first, curves curvature, then surfaces
curvature, and high-dimensional objects curvature.


#### Big Name
1. Huygens: 1673
1. All involutes of a curve are disjoint, means they don't cross each other.
2. They are perpendicular to the tangent line.

#### Curvature Definition one
line $NQ$ and line $CP$ are the normal line of the curve at point P and Q. the two normals will 
meet in some point,  as P and Q get closer and closer, the intersection of the two normal line
stablized. and it is the limit value, and the limit point is called the center of the curvature.

#### Curvature Definition two
Osculating Circle of point P at curve C.

The evolute of an involute is the original curve.

#### term
1. pascal triangle

#### two different view of thinking of curves
1. Cartesian form: a line is $l: ax+by+c=0$
2. Parameter form: $l: (a+tx,b+ty)$
3. ancient greek mathemation think curves purly geometry objects. 
4. 17th century mathmatain think they can be algebraic objects. or could be parameter objects.


#### parametrized curves and algebraic curves
1. rational parametrization


#### Terminology: algebraic curve
A curve with an equation:
$$
P(x,y) = 0
$$
where p is a ploynomial in x,y, usually with rational coefficients, which called algebraic curve.


#### Question: can we parametrize higher degree curves? 
1. this question is fundamental and natural.


#### Terminology
1. tangent line
2. tangent conic
3. tangent cubic

#### Terminology
1. tangent plane
 

#### Therom
For a cubic polynomial $p(x)$, all the tangent conics $T_r^2p(x)}$ are disjoint.


#### What is differential geometry

Differential Geometry is a mathematical discipline that uses the techiniques of differential calculus, integral calculus,
linear algebra and multilinear algebra to study problems in geometry.

#### Frenet-Serret formulas 
Frenet-serret formulas or Frenet-Serret frame  describe the kinematic propertis of a particle 
moving along a continuous, differentiable curve in three dimensional Euclidean space.

#### Geometry Object
1. Oloid: An oloid is a three-dimensional curved geometric object that was dicovered by Paul Schatz
in 1929.

#### principal
1. 微分几何的概念和结论都是在一个原则下展开的，**所讨论的东西要与坐标选取无关**, 爱因斯坦花了七年才
建立相对论，就是因为他想极力摆脱坐标系的困扰.
2. 内蕴的思想: 你碰到的所有概念和结论都是内蕴的，就是说他们只和这个流形有关，和manifold所在的空间无
关。
3. 张量: 如果去读陈省身的微分几何讲义，对张量的理解只能停留在数学定义。所以，那张量究竟是什么，二阶
张量不过就是矩阵，一般的张量不过就是矩阵的推广。
从张量来重新定义度量，因为张量是内蕴的概念，只和这个流形有关。
4. 黎曼几何的度量是张量用来衡量度量空间中的距离和角度。

#### word
1: locus is a curve or other figure formed by all the points satisfying a particular equation of
the relation between coordinates.

#### notation
1. $\tilde{\gamma}$: the tilde is used to denote the geometric relation "is
   similar to" in mathematics.

#### Galois
1. After a long time, I think I really understand what does differential geometry
mean. Before learn differential geometry, in order to calculate the arc
length,<br />
$$
\mathrm{S}=\int_{\mathrm{a}}^{b}
\sqrt{1+\left(\mathrm{f}^{\prime}(\mathrm{x})\right)^{2}} \mathrm{d} \mathrm{x}
$$
2. But now, I want to deal with this in a new way, I don't want to depend on the
   specific coordinate system. How to deal with that, The answer is vector calculus.
3. These guy are so brilliant.
