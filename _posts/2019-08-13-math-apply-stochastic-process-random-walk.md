#### Introduction
1. Stochastic processes which are processes that proceed randomly in time.
2. We consider sequences $X_0,X_1,X_2,\cdots$ where $X_n$ represents some random
   quantity at time n.
How do you prevent oil spills? <br />
How do you prevent nuclear plants from going off?<br />
How do you prevent nuclear weapons from falling in the hands of the wrong people?<br />
These again, are probability issues.<br />
If you say there is one change in a billion that something will happen, 3/4 people will say
that's not acceptable. **I don't want any risk, these people are fools**, but unfortunately,
these fools outnumber those of us who have studied these issues.

#### set theory
1. Sample space: there elements in that sample space  
2. events:   events are subsets of the sample space.
3. sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points --from Merriam Webster
4. according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, it's a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.



#### Galois
1. probability and statistics is an apply subject. Knowledge we learn in
   calculus, and set theory all can be used in this subject.
2. Gamma function is from calculus, Jacobian matrix is also from calculus. They
   all can be used to study probability and statistics.
