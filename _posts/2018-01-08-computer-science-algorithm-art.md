#### A
1. When I watch how Abdul Bari write a program, or implement an algorithm! It's an
art.  He just do things in such an elegant and natural way.


#### B
1. When he implement the BFS algorithm, he write the pseudo code step by step.
   You feel like it's not difficult, it's natural, eazy, elegant beautiful.
2. When he describe KMP algorithm, how he use the counter in pattern and target
   string.
