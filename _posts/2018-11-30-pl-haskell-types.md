#### Typeclasses
A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behavior. If a type is a
part of a typeclass, that means that it supports and implements the behavior the

  they are like classes in object oriented languages. Well, they're not.
- You can think of them kind of as Java interfaces, only better.

#### H
