#### Definition
1. Related Variables: Variables X and Y are related variables if there is any change in
the conditional distribution of Y, given X=x, as x changes
2. Unrelated: We say that variables X and Y are unrelated if they are
   independent.
3. Response Variable and Predictor Variable: we think of Y as a dependent
   variable(depending on X) and of X as an independent variable(free to vary).
   Our goal, then, is to predict the values of Y given the value of X. In this
   situation, we call Y the response variable and X the predictor variable.
4. Confounding Variables:
