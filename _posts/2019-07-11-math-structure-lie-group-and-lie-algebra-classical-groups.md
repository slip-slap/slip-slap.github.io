#### Terminology
1. GL(N,R): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is real number 
2. GL(N,C): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is complex number 
3. GL(N,Q): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is quaternion number 
<br />

1. Operation: I said it's a group, I should tell you the group operation. The 
operation are matrix multiplication.
2. Element: All invertible $N \times N$ matrices with entries from corresponding
   field.


####  Definition
$$
\begin{array}{l}{N_{(+,\cdot)} e_{n}} \\ {(,) \text{   }  \mathbb{F}}\end{array}
$$
A Vector space, given the basis unit, a certain field, vector space scalar and
multiplication, inner product. That's all we need for a vector space.


#### Galois
1. The relationship between Lie group and Lie Algebra, first, we have Lie group,
   and we want to study the properties of Lie group, so we call it lie algebra.
