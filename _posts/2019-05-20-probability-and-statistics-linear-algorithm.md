#### what is matrix and  matrix multification[1]
+ purpose: scientists come up with matrix and matrix multification is for Gaussian Elimination method
+ matrix: they call the crap grey circled  **Matrix**, that is where the matrix come from
+ multification: for the elimination purpose, they call the operation multification

<hr />

#### matrix multification is a function[2]


<hr />

#### variance and covariance matrix

+ for short, we named the term covariance matrix

+ definition, if the entries in the column vector $$
\mathbf{X}=\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}
$$are random variables

$$
\mathrm{K}_{X_{i} X_{j}}=\operatorname{cov}\left[X_{i}, X_{j}\right]=\mathrm{E}\left[\left(X_{i}-\mathrm{E}\left[X_{i}\right]\right)\left(X_{j}-\mathrm{E}\left[X_{j}\right]\right)\right]
$$

where the operator **E** denotes the expected value of its argument
