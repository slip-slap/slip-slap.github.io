#### Galois
1. Stochastic Process is a collection of random variables indexed by time, this
   is the formal definition of stochastic process
2. Given the $DP(\alpha, H(0))$, a point is generate from this thing, and this
   point itself is a random variable, so we call this thing $DP(\alpha, H(0))$ 
   Dirichlet Process. Because it meet the definition of a process.
