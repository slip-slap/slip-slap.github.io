####
1. relaxation



#### Relationship with Backtracking
1. It also use a state space tree to solve the problem
2. but it is useful to solve optimization problem, and only minimization
   problem.



#### Galois
1. branch and bound try to exhaustivly explore all the possibility, but it
   prunes the node that is not going to be the solution.
-  this is called relaxation



#### Reference
1. [coursear branch and bound](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/discrete-optimization/knapsack-5-relaxation-branch-and-bound-66OlO)
