#### Inspiration

#### Lesson
Alough the original inspiration for the field of artificial neural networks came
from biology, at times we forget to look back to biology for new ideas. **It
will be the blending of biology, mathemtatics, psychology and other disciplines
that will provide the maximum growth in our understanding of neural networks.**
