#### Inspiration
1. a human has $10^11$ neurons to facilitate your reading, breathing, motion and
   thinking.

2. a neurons have three princpal components: the dendtrites, the cell body and
   the axon.

- Some of the neural structures is defined at birth. Others are developed
  through learning, as new connections are make and others wates away
- It has been shown that if a young cat is denied use of one eye during a
  critical windown time, it will never develop normal vision in that eye.
- Linguists have discovered that infants over six months of age can no longer
  discriminate certain speech sounds.


3. biological neurons are very slow when compared to electrical circuits$(10^-3) compared
to 10^-10). The brain is able to perform many tasks much faster than any
conventional computer.


#### Notation
1. Scalars: small italic letters: $\emph{a,b,c}$
2. Vectors: small bold nonitalic letters: $\textbf{a,b,c}$
3. Matrices: campital Bold nonitalic letters: $\textbf{A,B,C.}$
