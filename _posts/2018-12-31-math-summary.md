#### Galois
We copy concept from one subject to another, and hope it may work.
1. complement, in probability, in combinatorics
2. function, in real analysis, in topology, in group theory
3. duality, in geometry 
4. generator, in group theory, in probability 


#### Thoughts
1. What is math ? It's all about math object. 
2. What is math object, it's depends on how you define it.
- Galois thought group is an math object.
- Complex number maybe an object.

#### 2. Architecture
math can be divided into four parts, structure, space, change, application, and
discrete.

1. Difference between space and structure

- $R^N$, Banach space, Normed vector space, Metric space, Hilbert space,
   Inner product space, vector space. modern mathematics uses many types of
   spaces.  it does not define the notion of "space" itself
- Neither of these words space and structure have a single mathematical
   definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same
   situations, but you often think of a "space" as more geometric and a
   "structure as more algebraic. So you could thinke of "structures" as places
   we do algebra, and "spaces" we do geometry. 
- The distinction between geometric "space" and algebraic "structure" is
   sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, groups are algebraic, while
   Euclidean spaces are geometric.


#### 3 Notation

#####  3.1 Greek Alphabet

<img src="{{IMAGE_PATH}}/math-greek-alphabet.jpg"  />

1. $ \xi \mapsto p_{\xi} $: sign between $\xi$ and $p_{\xi}$ means maps to
2. $ \xi $ and $ \Xi $ prounced |zai| in English, prounced |ksi| in modern
   Greek.
3. $\phi$ or $\varphi$  and  $\Phi$, these two letters are the same, but little change
4. $\psi$ and $\Psi$, usually stands for wave function in quanum mechanics.


##### 3.2 Change Mathematics
- $\partial$: denote as a partial derivative such as $ \frac{\partial
  z}{\partial x} $.
- It represents a specialized cursive letter of d. It may simply pronounced
   simply "dee".


##### 3.3 Applied Mathematics

1. Probability and Statistics
- $\Pi$ denotes a finite set of objects, $\pi$ denotes a member in the set.
- X denoted a real-valued functions(sometimes called a measurement)


#####  brackets
1. curly brackets: {} which means the order doesn't matter.
2. square brackets: [] the order matters.
3. tilde $ \tilde $ means: denote an equivalence between two objects.x $ \tilde $y
4. raised asterisk $*$: used to denote adjoint.
5. hat over letter: used to denote an estimated value, as opposed to its
   theoretical counterpart, for example, in the context of errors and residuals,
   the "hat" over the letter $\epsilon$ indicates an observable estimate (the
   residuals) of an unobservable quantity called $\epsilon$(the statistical
   errors).

#### Galois
1. sometimes I think mathematicians are the most brillant people in the world,
   they create so many beautiful things.
2. Actually, there are som many problems which are undefined, the ability of
   human is limited. 
- $6/0$
- vector + matrix
- infinity + infinity


#### Reference
1. you often think space more geometric, such as metric space, Hilbert space,
   norm space. structure more algebraic, such as in group theory.
