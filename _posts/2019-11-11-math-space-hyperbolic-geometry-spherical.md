#### History
1. There is no difference between astronomer and mathimatican, all mathimatican
   are insterested in astronomy, and all astronomers are mathimaticans.
2. Greeks, Archimedes
3. Indias
4. Arabs

#### Concept 
Why we are so interested in sphere, because the celestial sky, the moon, the sun
are all sphere.
1. The term sphere refers to only to the surface itself, if we want to talk about
the region in this sphere, we use the term  ball.
2. Analogous to the circular objects in two dimensions, where a circle
   circumscribes its disk.

#### Line 
1. In Euclidean geometry, a line is shortest path though two points.
2. The equator shown here is the intersection of the sphere S with a plane P
through the center O.

#### Definition
1. Lines d,f,g are concurrent $$ Leftrightarrow $$ they pass through a common point
A.
2. Poins A,B,C are collinear $$ Leftrightarrow $$ they lie on a common line d.
3. A triangle $ \overline{ABC}$ is a set {A,B,C} of three non-collinear
   points.
4. A trilateral $\overline{dfg}$ is a set {d,f,g} of three non-concurrent lines.


#### Question
On a big sphere, the geometry looks close to Eucliden: lines, points,
circles,perpendicularity.
1. How do we measure?
2. How is Euclidean geometry modified?
3. Do we have midpoints, Pythagoras, orthocenters, circumcircles?

#### Answer
1. Any two points A, B can be joined by a unique line unless $B=\overline{A}$


#### HAHA
n-sphere: in mathematics, the n-sphere is the generalization of the ordinary
sphere to spaces of arbitrary dimension, it is an d-dimensional manifold that
can be embedded in Euclidean (n+1)-space.
1. The 0-sphere is a pair of points.
2. The 1-sphere is a circle.
3. The 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere.
4. Generally, when embeded in an (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space, an n-sphere
   is the surface or boundary of an (n+1)-dimensional ball.
