#### Dense set
Dense set: a subset A of a topological space X is called dense in(X) if every point x in X either belongs to A or is a limit point of A. <br />
the closure of A is constiuting the whole set X.

#### Examples 
The rational numbers are a dense subset of real numbers.

#### Nowhere dense set
In mathematics, a nowhere dense set on a topological space is a set whose closure has empty interior.

#### Examples
1. Z is nowhere dense in R




#### countable
In mathematical terms, a set is countable either if it's finite, or it is infinite and you can find a one-to-one correspondence between the elements
of the set and the set of natural numbers.


#### definition
1. Interior point: If S is a subset of a Euclidean space, then x is an interior point of S if there exists an open ball centered at x which
is completely contained in S.
2. Adherent point(contact point, closure point): A point x is an adherent point for A if and only if x is in the closure of A.
3. Limit point(cluster point,accumulation point): A limit point of a set S in a topological space X is a point that can be approximated by points
of S in the sense that every neighbourhood of x with respect to the topology on X also contains a point of S other than x itself. A limit point of a set
S does not itself have to be an element of S.


#### set closure
The clousre of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A. CLosed sets are closed under arbitrary intersection, so it is the also the intersection of
all closed sets containing A.
1. the closure of a set A, it is just A with all of its accumulation points.


#### How to compare the number of two sets ?

1. Method 1: get the number of the first set A, and the second set B. According to the sign of A minus B to depend which one is bigger.
2. Method 2: Imaging a scenirao, in an ancient community, and they don't know math. There are two hunters both of whom obtained several
animals, how to campare who is outnumber who. 
We can solve this problem in the following way, A throws an animal, and at the same time B throws an animal, too. The guy who is the first one
run out of animal, who loses.

3. So we can use Method 2 to compare two infinite set. According to the rule of one to one, we can know which one has more numbers. 



#### Russell's Barbers Paradox
Consider a group of barbers who shave only those men who do not shave themselves. Suppose
there is a barber in this collection who does not shave himself; then by the definition of 
the collection, he must shave himself. But no barber in the collection can shave himself.
