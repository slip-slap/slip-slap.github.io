#### Why bother?
1. We prefer concept which are from intuition, such as the tangent line of a curve
at a specific point, it is easy to understand.
2. Speaking of structure, it's not something intuitive, it's pure mathematics

- for example, in real anaysis, we build structure addition of two numbers.
- To mimick this property, we add structure on complex domain, what does it
  mean? I don't know, it's just the structure we want to adopt.
- we can also adopt $\sigma$ and $\delta$ to define limit on complex number
  domain.



#### Galois
1. That's the beauty of structure, we don't need to know it's meaning, but we
   know it makes sense.
