#### Definition
1. Module: vector space can be generialized something more powerfull, this is called module, which
is a generialized vector space.

##### difference
1. In a vector space, the set of scalars is a field and acts on the vectors by scalar multiplication,
subject to certain axioms such as the distributive law.
2. In a module, the scalars need only be a ring.

##### Relationship 
1. Module is vector space with a ring of scalars 
2. Vector Space is module with a field of scalars

#####  Example
1. Modue: M =  any Abelian group
2. Scalars: R = Z
3. Every albelian group is a Z-module.
