#### Inspiration
1. The xy-plane in $R^3$ is the prototype of a regular submanifold of a
   manifold. It is defined by the vanishing of the coordinate function z.


#### Definition
A subset S of a manifold N of dimension n is a regular submanifold of dimension
k if for every $p\in S$ there is a coordinate neighborhood $
(U, \phi)=\left(U, x^{1}, \ldots, x^{n}\right)
$ of p in the maximal atlas of N such that $
U \cap S
$ is defined by the vanishing of n-k of the coordinate functions. By renumbering
the coordinates, we man assume that these n-k coordinates functions are $
x^{k+1}, \ldots, x^{n}
$
