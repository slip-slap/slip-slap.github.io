#### problem with differential
$d(xy)=xdy+ydx$

$$
(x+dx)(y+dy)-xy=xdy+ydx+dxdy
$$ <br />
1. Leibniz think $dxdy$ are too small, you can get rid of them. 
2. at that time the concept of "limit" havn't appear. Newton has the same idea.
3. As far as I am concerned, if you get rid of something, such as $dxdy$, and
   they are not equal zero, the result will not be accurate.
4. but the fact is opposite, it is **accurate**, although, there are some flaw
   with this theorem. The result is **accurate!!!**


#### What does arithmetical consist of ?
Addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and take roots <br />
J$\cdot$Gregory thinks that limit operation is also an arithmetical operation.
