#### a circle in different coordinate systems
1. Cartesian Coordinate System can represents a cirlce, Polar Coordinate System can represents a circle. 
2. what's the difference ? It's just the same thing display in two different coordinate systems, and polar coordinate can bring calculation convience.
3. This relationship suits the Fourier Transformation


#### Galois
1. Taylor expansion just use a special family of functions which are **polynomial
   function** to represent any transcental function.
2. Fourier also use a special family of function which are **sin and cos
   function** to represent any transcental function.
