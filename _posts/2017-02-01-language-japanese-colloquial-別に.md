#### 特に
It's an expression particularly because you can use it with the negative to express a lack of
preference
- なんか食べたい物ある？
- 特にないけど(not particularly)

#### 別に
It's an expressiong to express a lack of preference for positive answers
- これ、借りていい？
- 別にいいよ(whatever, sure)

1. 別に means apart from but you don't really need to include from what exactly

- なんか食べたい物ある？
- 別にないけど


2. If you are wondering how to express your apathetic, non-caring, and sketchy personality,
   [別に] is the ticket
- 本当に行かなくてもいいの？
- 別に行かなくてもいいよ(whatever, I don't have to go)

3.  next time is badgering you with questions, you can just reply with 別に. make sure you say it
	with plenty of spit and a look of complete contempt while you're at it. It'll be like "whatever"

4. "never mind" or "I didn't say anything"
- 好きです
- えっ、何
- 別に
