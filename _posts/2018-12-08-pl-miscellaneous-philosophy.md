#### Background
The main question is: when faced with a problem, do we always have the choice
between a declarative and imperative approaches to solving it?
1. If there is a declarative solution, can it always be translated into computer
   code?
2. The answer to this question is far from obvious and, if we could find it, we
   would probably revolutinonize our understanding of universe.

#### Related Area
Richard Feynman mentions this duality as an inspiration in his own work on
quantum electrodynamics.
1. There are two forms of expressing most laws of physics. One used local,or
   infinitesimal, considerations.
2. We look at the state of a system around a small neighborhood, and predict how
   it will evolve within the next instant of time.
3. This is usually expressed using differential equations that have to be
   integrated, or summed up. over a period of time.
  


The other approach is global.
