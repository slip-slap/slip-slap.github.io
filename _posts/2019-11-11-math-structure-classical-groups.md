#### HAHA
1. GL(N,R): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is real number 
2. GL(N,C): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is complex number 
3. GL(N,Q): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is quaternion number 
<br />

1. Operation: I said it's a group, I should tell you the group operation. The 
operation are matrix multiplication.
2. Element: All invertible $N \times N$ matrices with entries from corresponding
   field.


#### HAHA
$$
\begin{array}{l}{N_{(+,\cdot)} e_{n}} \\ {(,) \text{   }  \mathbb{F}}\end{array}
$$
A Vector space, given the basis unit, a certain field, vector space scalar and
multiplication, inner product. That's all we need for a vector space.
