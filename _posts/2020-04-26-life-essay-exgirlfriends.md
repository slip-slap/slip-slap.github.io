Life is unfair, you love somebody so much, but she didn't love you back.


It's a sad story, I felt I had a feeling for her after I saw her, and I was
incredible attacted to her. I wrote her a love letter.

It has been three years, I just can't get her out of my mind, although I can't
picture her appearance in my mind. Sometimes I wake up in the midnight, just
imaging some guy taking off her clothes and fucking her, I can't stand with
it. Althogh she is a bitch, I admit it.
