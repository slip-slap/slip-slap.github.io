#### Principal Curvature In differential geometry, the two principal curvatures
at a given point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the
point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different
directions at that point.


#### Gaussian Curvature
1. Euler: normal curvatures had a maximum and minimum value in two perpendicular
   directions, which are called principal directions.
2. In differential geometry, the Gaussian curvature or Gauss curvature $K$ of a
   surface at a point is the product of the principal curvatures, $k_1$ and
   $k_2$ at the given point.

$$
K = k_1k_2
$$

#### Elliptic Point
1. A point $p$ on a regular surface $M\in R^3$ is said to be elliptic if the
   Gaussian curvature $K(p)
>0$, the principal curvatures $k_1$ and $k_2$ have the same sign. **which means
>the surface is on
the one side of the tangent plane.**

#### Hyperbolic Point
1. one curve goes one side of the tangent plane, and the other curve goes the
   other side of the tangent plane.
2. Asympotic Lines: the curve tangent plane meets the surface.
the lines are flat, the center of the curvature is infinity.

#### Parabolic Point
1. A point $p$ on a regular surface $M\in R^3$ is said to be parabolic if the
   Gaussian curvature $ K(p)=0$ but $s(p)\neq 0$(where $s$ is the shape
   operator), or equivalently, exactly one of the principal curvatures $k_1$,
   $k_2$ equals 0

##### Monkey Saddle
##### Horse Saddle

#### Theorm:
1. Meusnier's Theorem: If every point on a surface is umbilic, then the surface
   is sphere or plane
2. Umbilical Point In the differential geometry of surfaces, in three
   dimensions, umbilics or  umbilical points are points on a surface that are
   locally spherical. At such points the normal curvatures in all directions are
   equal, hence, both principal curvatures are equal, and every tangent vector
   is a principal direction. The name "umbilic" comes from Latin umbilicus
