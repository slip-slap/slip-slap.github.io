#### /t/
Its pronounciation has two cases:
1. When it appears in a sentence, such as the last /t/ in *nice to meet you*, it
   still make some voiceless sound. But it is different from a standard /t/
   sound, We make this sound by stoping the air flow from throat to the mouse,
   and this action will make a sound.
2. A standard /t/.


#### Can and can't
The pronounciation of *can* is more smooth than *can't*, since *can't* needs
stop the air flowing from throat into mouth.  So the sound of *can't* is more
abrupt.

- The lyric *Hello, can you hear me? Hello from the outside.* sounds beautifully
  and smoothly if pronounce it correctly. Please relax you mouth when you try to
  make this.
