#### 1. Necessary and Required
Required is used in the context of arbitrary rules and regulations, that is,
when there is some requirement by law or convention that must be must be met in
order for something to happen.

**Example.** A password is required by law when a person is travelling from one
country to another, and drivers are required to carry their driver's license
with them when they are driving.

  Necessary is used when we want to say that something is needed logically or as
a practical matter and **without it some desired result cannot be obtained.**


**Example.** some form of electricity is necessary for the operation of
electrical devices, and it is necessary for a person to have reached puberty for
him or her to be able to be a biological parent.


#### 2. Need vs. Entail
As verbs the difference between need and entail is that need is to be nessary
while entail is to imply or require.


#### 3. Stage, period and phase
According to the wikipedia, the definition is as the following: 1) Period - A
length or portion of time;  2) Stage - A point, period, or step in a process or
development; 3) Phase - A distinct period or stage in a process of change or
forming part of something's development.

**Difference.** The difference is that *stage* refers to a particular level that
you are at, *period* is more like a span of time, and *phase* is like a state of
transition.

#### 4. Classic vs. Classical

The word *classic* is most commonly used as an adjective meaning "judged over a
period of time to be of the highest quality and outstanding of its kind."" On
the other hand, the term *classical* is used as an adjective meaning "of or
relating to the ancient Greek and Roman world and expecially to literature, art,
or ideals."

**Difference.** The word *classic* emphasis its quality; on the other hand,
classic emphasis the order.


#### Process vs. Procedure

In the 2005 edition of ISO 9000, the difference between process and procedure
was defined as:
- *A process* is a set of interrelated or interaction activities which transform
  inputs into outputs.
- *A procedure* is specified way to carry out an activity or a process.

The difference is that a process is about what to do and a procedure is about
how we do something. But we is the difference between *how* and *what*? So this
is definition is not clear? So we use the following method:
- A process as being something that has inputs, outputs and activities and can be
represented as a diagram.
- The procedure then becomes a description of how the activity is carried out;
  generally in text form.
