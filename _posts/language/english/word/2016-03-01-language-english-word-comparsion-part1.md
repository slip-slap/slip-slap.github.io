#### 1. Necessary and Required
Required is used in the context of arbitrary rules and regulations, that is,
when there is some requirement by law or convention that must be must be met in
order for something to happen.

**Example.** A password is required by law when a person is travelling from one
country to another, and drivers are required to carry their driver's license
with them when they are driving.

  Necessary is used when we want to say that something is needed logically or as
a practical matter and **without it some desired result cannot be obtained.**


**Example.** some form of electricity is necessary for the operation of
electrical devices, and it is necessary for a person to have reached puberty for
him or her to be able to be a biological parent.


#### 2. Need vs. Entail

while entail is to imply or require.
