#### Numeric vs. Numerical
The word *numeric* generally refes to or has to do with numers; on the other
hand, ther word *numerical* generally indicates a usage of numbers. It seems
they are interchangable in practice.

Trending right now: numeric value, numeric problems, numerical analysis.

#### Economic vs. Economical
*Economic* is used to describe that which is characterized by or relating to the
economy. *Ecomomical*, on the other hand, more often relates to being efficient,
or prudent.

**Examples.** 1) The president's proposed economic reform is being scrutinized
by Congress. 2) With six children under one roof, our parents were forced ot be
economical early on.
