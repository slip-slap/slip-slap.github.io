#### Angry vs. Upset
The word *angry* is stronger feeling than *upset*. They are not quite the same,
you cannot always use *upset* to mean *angry*, or vice versa.

#### Numeric vs. Numerical
The word *numeric* generally refes to or has to do with numers; on the other
hand, ther word *numerical* generally indicates a usage of numbers. It seems
they are interchangable in practice.

Trending right now: numeric value, numeric problems, numerical analysis.

#### Economic vs. Economical
*Economic* is used to describe that which is characterized by or relating to the
economy. *Ecomomical*, on the other hand, more often relates to being efficient,
or prudent.

**Examples.** 1) The president's proposed economic reform is being scrutinized
by Congress. 2) With six children under one roof, our parents were forced ot be
economical early on.


#### Adequate and sufficient
1. Adequate and sufficient are very closely in meaning, and both describe a
   situation where quantity meets the requirements but sufficient is slightly
   more than adequate.
2. Sufficient protection means enough protection, and the same is conveyed by
   adequate protection, but adequate reflects a level that is barely covering
   the requirements whereas sufficient reflect comfortable levels.
- Adequate means just able to fulfill the requirements or the purpose. If
  something is adequate, it implies that the quantities are not abundant or
  overflowing.

#### Entails and Implies
1. Entail ($$ A (\vDash) B$$):  every $B$ holds in every model of $A$, which
   means B is true in every structure in which A is true.
