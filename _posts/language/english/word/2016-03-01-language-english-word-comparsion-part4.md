#### Characteristic and feature
When speaking of an individual, the key difference between a feature and a
characteristic is that a feature is used to describe a distinctive part of the
face, while a characteristic refers to a quality that is typical of an
individual.


#### Score and Grade

- For example, if you got a 95% on a math test, that is your score. An 'A' would
  be your grade


#### Test and examination
The test is a tool to measure the knowledge level of your students and adjust
the learning material accordingly. An exam or the examination is more formal and
it tells you if a students passed or failed a class or course.


#### Point of view and perspective
Point of view: focuses on the type of narrator used to tell the story.
- From a practical point of view.

Perspective: focuses on how this narrator perceives what's happening within the
story.


#### Examine and check
They are not interchangeable. Checking something is often done less carefully
than examining that same thing.
1. You would tell your mother to "check" to mail to get letters, but you
   wouldn't tell her to "examine" it, because then she would just be standing
   outside the mailbox, staring at it.
2. You would, however, ask the doctor to "examine" you if you are sick with
   something, because it doesn't make sense grammaticall to ask your doctor to
   "check" you
