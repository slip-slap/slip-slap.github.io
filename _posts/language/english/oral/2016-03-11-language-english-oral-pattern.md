#### Pattern 1: verb + preposition phase
Get out of hand - This thing completely make sense if you interprate it in this
way, where *get* is a verb, and *out of hand* means out of control. This is
pretty common, examples are as follows:
- Come on: *on* means something happens.
- take into accound: *into account* 



#### Pattern 2: Move around a sentence
Pick up the part that you think is important, and place it at the begining of a
sentence. It could be anything, such as the subject, object, even a verb. For
example,
- Here it is: we want to focus on the place *here*, so we place it at the
  beginning.
It is weired to me when the first time I learned it from my english teacher in
junior school.
