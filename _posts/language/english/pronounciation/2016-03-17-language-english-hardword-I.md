#### Remark
For some very common words, such as *can, my,the, to, be, some, me*, I am not awared
my problem in pronounciation. My pronounciation is abrupt, lack of rhythm, since
I can't pronounce this trivial words correctly.

The focus of American pronounciation is in the vowel sound, so the consonant
sound is not important. You can hear the say the consotant sound in a lazy way.
For example, the Korean player *showmaker*, you should focus on the vowel part,
igore the constoant part, you will be understood well.

To pronounce correctly, it need the teamwork of your mouth, throat, and the
belly.
