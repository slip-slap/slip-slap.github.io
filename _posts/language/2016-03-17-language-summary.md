#### Pronounciation 
Pronounciation methods of these three lanuage are complete different, which
lead to the difference in our ears to recognizing sound. In Chinese, whether the
sound made from the vocal cord or not doesn't change the word it represents.
However, in Japan the case is complete different, they are two different words,
such as *ただいま*. In Japanse, the stop sound, such as *ちょっと*, and long
sound *習慣* means different words, that's how Japanese recognize the sound. In
American, the combination of vowel sound and Non-vowel sound comes are used to
represent words, where vowel sound is very important, and vowel sound can be
divided into longer vowel sound and short vowel sound. 

Corresponding to the pronounciation method, people's ear are different among
these three region. To learn a new language, you need train you ear to be able
to recognize the sounds which are different for the people whose mother language
is it, since the sound maybe feel the same for a newer, maybe complete different
for a local.






#### Remark
1. Both japanese and english have variation of verbs, appearing in different forms, which is complete different from chinese.
- I have been looking for something to learn.
- 何を探しているんですか？

#### Chinese
I am a native Chinese speaker, but I don't think I master this language at all.
Of coures, I understand what people are talking about, every topic, every areaa,
I can tell the small difference when people talk, the words, the tone. But the
problem lies in me is I can't express myself in a very concise and efficient
way. I should master some words in different area.   

In the 21st century, Chinese is the most important language in the world,
because the Chinese powerfull econemy capability, and military ability. But the
drawback of chinese is it is too difficult to master. 

#### English
I have learn English for so many years. Currently, American is the most
powerfull country in the earth, and English is the most popular language, There
is no doubt about that.
I can listen pretty well, I can understand what people are talking about, and I
can express myself. But the problem is I should try to improve my express
capabality, more accurate, more fluent. 

I favour english most, because in the world, english is the most common used
language in the world, for business, for communication, for techology, for
scientist, I should learn english.




#### Japanese
But at first I learn Japanese, it is completely a nightmare, I was too focused
on the meaning of every word in a phrase. I suffer a lot. I should treat them as
a whole, expeciall in the context of conversation, it will be much more easier.
Because Japanese language is influenced by Tang Dynasty and western countries, I
can learn Japanese pretty easily, and the problem lies me is the listening. I
should listen more, and memorize more words.



#### Galois
According to the experience that I learn language, here is some advices
1. First, you need to memorize words, it's the building blocks.
2. Second, listen, listen, and listen, listen different topics
3. memorize the word that is often used in some specific area.
4. Maybe, the most important thing is **Talk to yourself at home** 

For example, I love history, expecially world history, not only China or Japan,
I want to figure out, what the the other people is doing when China is in Tang
dynasty. Why Democracy and scitenist are very developed in Greece. I want to
know Napoleon, Alexander, Kublai Khan, Sultan. If you want to talk about movies,
you should the following famous movies, The shawshank Redemption, godfather, the
lord of the rings, pulp fiction, Inception, The matrix, seven samurai,
Crounching Tiger and hidden Dragon, The new world.


#### Galois
1. There is one word that confuse me a lot. According what I learn and express
   english in a chinese way. "let" is the choice to ask someone to do something.
   but, it's not, in English, it is **make**, I think this is the most frequent
   word in English, DON'T forget it.
2. You can't translate one language to the other language literly, because there
   is no words whose meaning are equivlant exactly between two different
   language. Before I went abroad, some guy told me if you go japan, you must
   master japanese. That's so not true. Between two different language, the
   difficult is not only the prounciation, but also the word choice, some
   sentence make sense in your culture, but not in the other culture. You should
   try to picture the scenario,  and pay attention to their word choices.
