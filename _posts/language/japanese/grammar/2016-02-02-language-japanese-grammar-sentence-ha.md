##### 1. with nonessence 

```
1. は indicates contrast, focus on the part before は
- 結果が出るまでには、長い年月が必要だろう
- 今の子供が大人になるまでには、様々な研究が進んでいるだろう
- 面と向かっては, it emphasises face to face.
2. が indicates new information
1. は: this particle emphasis content before は、
- 面白いはあります, this sentence implies existance of boring thing 
2. に: emphasis the content before it, no intention of comparsion
- 潤ちゃんにしようか, get 潤ちゃん do this, no imply of comparsion
3. が: emphasis the content after が
- 何が好き？
```
The content is enclosed by the delimiter, which is how I try to learn this before. However, this is not the essense..

##### 1. The essence
At the begginning of Japanese, These is only the one particle "が", without
"は". However, this is short to express more complicate idea, so people create
"は" to add new flavor to a sentence.
