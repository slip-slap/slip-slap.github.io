#### HAHA
1. we deal with geometry with a algebraic point of view.
2. geometry of "n-dim space", actually an affine space, and linear
   transformation.
#### definition: Affine Geometry
1. An affine geometry is a geometry in which properties are preserved by
   parallel projection from one plane to another.
2. As the notion of parallels independent of any metric, affine geometry is

3. With the following two picture, you can create the world

considered as the study of parallel lines.

#### Question:
1. How can we deal with geometry only knowing parallel lines ?
2. Can we do affine geometry without a grid ?

#### Geometry With Vectors
1. Translator a vector, how ?
2. Create equally spaced points, how ?
3. Add two vectors, how ?
4. Bisect a segment, how ?
5. Trisect a segment, how ?
6. Subtract vector, how ?


#### Question
1. Can we calculate area in affine geometry ?
2. Yes, we can
2. Volumes


#### what is a bivector ?
1. In mathematics, a bivector or 2-vector is a quantity in exterior algebra or
   geometric algebra that extends the idea of scalars and vectors.If scalar is
   considered an order zero quanity, and a vector is an order of one quantity,
   then a bivector can be thought of as being of order two.


2. Vector $\vec{a}$ is a directed line segment.
3. Bi-vector:
$
\vec{a} \vee \vec{b}
$ is a directed plane segment.

#### terminology
1. of, relating to, or being a transformation(as a translation, a rotation, or a
   uniform stretching) that carries straight lines into straight lines and
   parallel lines into parallel lines but may alter distance between points and
   angles between lines.


#### Affine Geometry and Euclidean Geometry
    1. Affine is a more generialized concept
    2. Euclidean Geometry is just one implecation of affine geometry

#### Affine plane and Euclidean planes
    1. Affine plane: an affine plane is a two-dimensional space, an affine space
       is a geometric structure that generalizes some of the properties of
       Euclidean spaces in such a way that these are independent of the concepts
       of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to
       parallelism.
    2. Euclidean planes is an affine plane over the reals, equipped with a
       metric, the Euclidean distance.  In other words, an affine plane over the
       reals in a Euclidean plane in which one has forgotten the metric.
    3. For every field or divison ring F is also an affine plane.
