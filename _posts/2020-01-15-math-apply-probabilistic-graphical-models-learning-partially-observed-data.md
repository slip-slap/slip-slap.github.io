#### Motivation
1. Hidden Variable: one never performs all possible tests or asks all of the
   possible questions 
- For example, some disease are not observed directly, but only via their
  symptoms
2. Incomplete Data: 


#### Definition
Let $$
\boldsymbol{X}=\left\{X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}\right\}
$$ be some set of random variables, and let $$
O_{X}=\left\{O_{X_{1}}, \ldots, O_{X_{n}}\right\}
$$ be their observability variable. The observability model is a joint
distribution$$
P_{m i s s i n g}\left(\boldsymbol{X}, O_{X}\right)=
P(\boldsymbol{X}) \cdot P_{\text {mising}}\left(O_{\boldsymbol{X}} |
\boldsymbol{X}\right)
$$, so that $P(\boldsymbol{X})$ is parameterized by parameters
$$\boldsymbol{\theta}$$
- When we have missiing data, the data-generation process actualy involues two
steps. In the first step, data are generated by sampling from the model. In this
step, values of all the variables are selected, The next step determines which
values we get to observe and which ones are hidden from us.
