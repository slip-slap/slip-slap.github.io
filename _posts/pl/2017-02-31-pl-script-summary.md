#### Introduction
The spectrum of scripting languages ranges from very small and highly
domain-specific languages to general-purpose programming languages
1. specific environments related
- Bash: for Unix or Unix-like operating system
- JavasScript: for web browers
2. general purpose language: Python
3. Editor language: vim


#### Text file in Dos and Unix
The text file in the Dos must be the same as it in Unix which I take for
granted. Actually, it is not:
1. Text files created on DOS/Windows machines have different line endings than
   files created on Unix/Linux.
2. Dos uses carriage return and line feed("\r\n") as a line ending, which Unix
   used just line feed("\n").




#### Remark
1. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation are "hard-core" programming. When you
   can write programs that grab blocks of memory on the fly, link them into
   useful strucures, and clean everything at the end so there is no residue,
   you're not just someone who can do a little coding, you're a programmer.
