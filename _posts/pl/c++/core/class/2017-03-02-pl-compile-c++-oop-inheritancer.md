#### Rules For calling the base class constructor
Base class constructos are automatically called for you if they have no
argument.
1. If you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument, you must use
   subclass's constructor initialization list.
2. Unlike Java, C++ supports multiple inheritance, so the base class must be
   referred to by name, rather than "super()"
