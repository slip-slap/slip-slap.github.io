#### Polymorphism
There are two major approaches to polymorphism in programming:
1. subtype polymorphism,  realized with inheritance and virtual functions:
   interface requirements are written as virtual functions of an abstract class,
   from which concrete classes are derived.
2. parametric polymorphism, realized with generics or templates that specify a
   class or function with type parameters.
