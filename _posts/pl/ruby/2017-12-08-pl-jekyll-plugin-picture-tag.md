#### Jekyll
1. jekyll server 
2. jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0
- This will make Jekyll's HTTP server bind to all available IPs.


#### Galois
What's the nature of a plugin?  It is used to extend functionality of
something.
- Plugins of vim, extending vim's functionality, are the corresponding command
  you can execute at the bottom of vim in the command mode.
- Plugins of jekyll, extending jekyll's ability, are the corresponding tags in
  the template file, page file, etc.
