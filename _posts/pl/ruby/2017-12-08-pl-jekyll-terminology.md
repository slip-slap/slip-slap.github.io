#### Pages and posts
Pages and posts are just two types of written content that's styled differently.
- Pages are content(like an "About" page) that isn't organized or displayed
  chronologically, but might be included in your website's main menu.
- Posts are meant to be used for content best organized by publication date.

2. The URLs for pages and posts are also different by default.
- Page URLs look like *MySite.com/about/*, while post URLs look like
  *MySite.com/2016/02/29/my-post-title.html.*
