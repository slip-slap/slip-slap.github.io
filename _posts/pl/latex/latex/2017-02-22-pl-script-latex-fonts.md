### 1. Category
Typefaces can be divided into three cateogories: serif, sans serif, monospaced.

#### 1.1 Serif
Serif is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger
stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font of family of fonts.


1. In the Chinese and Japanese writing systems, there are common type styles
  based on the regular script for Chinese characters akin to serif and sans
  serif.
2. In Mainland China, the most popular category of serifed-like typefaces is
   called Song(宋体); Black(黑体) is sans serif-like.
3. Times New Roman is a serif typeface.

#### 1.2 Sans serif
Sans serif is one that does not have extending features called "serif" at the
end of strokes. Sans-serif fonts tend to have less stroke width variation than
serif fonts. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or
minimalism.

#### 1.3 Monospaced
Monospaced type is the one that its letters and characters each occupy the same
amount of horizontal space. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the
letters and spacings have different widths.


### 2 Italic, roman, and blackletter
When used as adjectives, italic means designed to resemble a handwriting style
developed in Italy in the 16th century. Whereas roman means upright, as opposed
to italic.

- roman literally means nonitalic, which is not slant.

### 3. Fonts for mathematics
In general, anything that represents a variable should be set in italic type, and anything else shoud be set in roman type.
- This applies equally to characters from the Lation/English alphabet as to letters from any other alphabet.
- Any operator, such as cos should be set roman.


1. Blackboard bold is a typeface style that is often used for certain symbols
   in mathematical texts, in which certain lines of the symbol(usually
   vertical or near-vertical lines) are doubled.
- The symbols usually denote number sets, such as $$ \mathbb{R} $$
