#### Cusomizing with biblatex
The goals are as follows:
1. Suppressing of specific BibTex fields(e.g., *publisher*)
2. Formatting of fields for specific entry types(e.g., titles of articles not
   inside quotation marks)
3. Formatting of citation postnotes(i.e., getting rid of "p./pp.")
4. Order of certain fields in the bibliography
5. Order of first names and last names of authors/editors in the bibliography;
