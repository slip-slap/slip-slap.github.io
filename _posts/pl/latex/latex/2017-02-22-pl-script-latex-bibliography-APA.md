#### How reference are constructed
In general, a reference should contain four elements: the author's name("who"),
date of publication("when"), title of the work("what"), and source
data("where"). The four elements always appear in the same order:
- Author, A.A. (year). Title. Source.
- This is the basic principle behind all APA style references.
