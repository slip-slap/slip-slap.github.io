#### What is a package?
You can think of a package in latex as a library in programming language, which
provides additional functionality.

- A package in latex corresponds to a file with sty extension.


#### difference between sty file and cls file
1. loading a class file via \\documentclass is mandatory.
- In the ideal case, a class file will complete define the structure of the
  document, the familir article is good example: which provides commands for
  typesetting, such as \\section, \\tableofcontents.

2. package are used to provide generic functionality to any document.

#### Galois
1. Treat latex as a programming language, and treat sty file as a third-party library.

#### Reference
1. [sty and cls](http://dw.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-3/asknelly/nelly-sty-&-cls.pdf)
