#### Concept
1. \hsize: horizontal size is a TeX primitive that should not be usually used in Latex.
2. \textwidth: the constant width of the total text block.
3. \columnwidth the constant width of a single column of test.
4. \linewidth is a variable that represents the current size of the line of text. 
- \linewidth may changed in a nested list, \hsize, \testwidth, \columnwidth don't change.
