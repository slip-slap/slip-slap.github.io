#### Character sets, character maps and code pages
Historically, the terms "character encoding", "character map", "character set"
and "code page" were synonymous in computer science.
		

#### Tabstop and space
Tabs need less characters and are formatted by users(some display as 2, some as
4 spaces), what can make some code look bad on some other environment. Godd
editors have re-tab functions to convert those.
