#### A
1. Category theory deals with structure - rather than dealing with particulars.
   It deals with the kind of structure that makes programs composable. Actually, we've been
   composing things forever
- Some great engineer came up with the idea of subroutine
- The principles of structural programming that made blocks of code composable
- Object oriented programming, which is all about composing objects
- Functional programming is not only about composing functions and algebraic data structures, it
  makes concurrency composable, something that's virtually impossible with other programming
  paradigms.
