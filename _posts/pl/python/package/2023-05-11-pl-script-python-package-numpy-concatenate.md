#### concatenate() 
The concatenate() function is the opposite of np.sum(arr,
axis), the common is that change happened along the specified axis: np.sum(arr,
axis) function collapse the specifed axis, and np.concatenate() expand the
specified axis.


#### The Zero in numpy
The Zero in numpy is an array with shape (0, number1, number2...), the first
number in this tuple has to be zero, the rest number can be any number. And it's
easy to figure out.
- This idea is very powerful, which is similar to zero in number, you can
  manipulate similar operation.
- Just like zero in Categorical theory and the haskell.
