#### What is a pull request?
You make local code changes and then submit those changes to a remote project
maintainer for review before those changes implemented, or merged.


This is called a pull request; you are requesting that someone reviews and
approves your changes before then become final.



#### How to do this?
After forking the repository on the remote hosting service and cloning it to
your local machine, you can start working on making changes to the code.


After you're happy with the changes, you can push the work up to your fork and
open a full request that will signal the main repo. This pull request asks the
maintainer to review your work, provide comments, request edits.
