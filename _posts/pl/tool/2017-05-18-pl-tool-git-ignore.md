#### Incentive?
1. specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- File are already tracked by Git are not affected.



#### Pattern
1. A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
2. A line starting with # serves as a comment.




#### Reference
1. [git ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
