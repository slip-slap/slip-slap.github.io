#### 1. Foundation
1. biological and psychological foundations of neural network

####
1. neural network architectures
2. learning rules: are heavily inspired by biology and psychology.
3. training techiques
3. feedforward neural network



##### Training
training algorithm plagued by the possible existance of local minima or "flat
spots".
The networks suffer from "the curse of dimensionality"

#### Sentence
1. Learning is viewed as the establishment of connections between neurons or modification of
   existing connections.

#### Application
1. their application to practical engineering problems in such areas as nonlinear regression,
   pattern recogition, signal processing, data mining and control system.
2. function approximation, probability estimation, pattern recognition, clustering and prediction
