The analytical methods are generally quite cumbersome, and require many
simplifying assumptions.

ANN based methods have been proved to ba a reliable tool to model different
engineering systems under practical conditions without involving in solving
complicated mathematical models.

#### 1. Foundation
1. biological and psychological foundations of neural network

####
1. neural network architectures
2. learning rules: are heavily inspired by biology and psychology.
3. training techiques
3. feedforward neural network



##### Training
1. training algorithm plagued by the possible existance of local minima or "flat
spots".
2. The networks suffer from "the curse of dimensionality"
3. The mean square error between target and actual outputs averaged over all
   examples(the desired and the prediction ouput values).

#### Sentence
1. Learning is viewed as the establishment of connections between neurons or modification of
   existing connections.

#### Application
1. their application to practical engineering problems in such areas as nonlinear regression,
   pattern recogition, signal processing, data mining and control system.
2. function approximation, probability estimation, pattern recognition, clustering and prediction
