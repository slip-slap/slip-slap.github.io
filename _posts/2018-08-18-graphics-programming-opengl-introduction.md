#### Introduction
1. Most implementations are built by graphics card manufactures. Whenever there is a bug in the
   implementation is usually solved by updating your video card drivers; those drivers include the
   newest versions of OpenGL that your card supports. This is one of the reasons why it's always
   advised to occassionally update your graphic drivers.
