#### Definition
1. Partial derivatives of vectors: If $\mathbf{A}$ is a vector depending on more
   than one scalar variable, say $x,y,z$ for example, then we write
   $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A}(x,y,z)$, the partial derivative of $\mathbf{A}$ with
   respect to x is defined as 
   $
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial x}=\lim _{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}
   \frac{\mathbf{A}(x+\Delta x, y, z)-\mathbf{A}(x, y, z)}{\Delta x}
   $
