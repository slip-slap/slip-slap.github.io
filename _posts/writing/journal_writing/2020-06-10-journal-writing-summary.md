How to write a paper? You need ask the purpose: writing a papter is trying to
explain something.  In order to explain this well, people develop patterns for
it. A papter includes abstract, introduction, methodology, conclusion. All these
things are used for explain an idea.

1. What's purpose of abstract?
- To get reader interest in your research. To achieve this, explain you work
  simple and efficient.

2. What's the purpose of conclusion?
- To summary your work, the conclusion is about something you have done.


Here are some points that you should pay attention to:
1. The subject of every sentence should be a fact, or something that is used in
   the scientific community.


You paper is the big idea: to finish this, you separate the paper to different
parts.  In each parts, there are some points you need pay attention.

It feels like you are filling blanks. The outline is there, just drop your
content there.


#### Galois
1. The order to write a Journal should from the end to the beginning, not the
   other way around. The reason is that because the conclusions need be
   supported by the work before.
