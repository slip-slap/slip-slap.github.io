#### When to use
1. A first-person I or we is also appropriate when it's the subject of a verb
naming an action unique to you as the writer of your argument.
- verbs referring to such actions typically appear in introductions(I will
  show/argue/prove/claim that X) and in conclusions(I have
  demonstrated/concluded that Y). Since only you can show, prove, or claim
  what's in your argument, only you can say so with I.
2. On the other hand, researchers rarely use the first person for an action that
   others must repeat to replicate their research. Those words include divide,
   measure, weigh, examine, and so on.
- Researchers rarely write sentences with active verbs like this:
- I calculated the coefficient of X.
