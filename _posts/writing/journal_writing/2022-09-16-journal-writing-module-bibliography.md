There are two types of bibliography: author date and notes and bibliography

#### Author date
1. MLA
2. APA


#### Notes and bibliography
1. Chicago

#### Types of in-text citation
1. Parenthetical citation: you put the source reference in parentheses directly
   in your text. This usually includes the author's last name along with the
   publication date and/or the page number.
2. Numeric citation: You number each of your sources in the reference list and
   use the correct number when you want to cite a source.
