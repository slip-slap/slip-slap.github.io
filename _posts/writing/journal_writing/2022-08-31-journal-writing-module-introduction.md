The introduction parts includes four points:
1. context 
2. problem
3. significance(so what)
4. outline



#### how to introduce 
1. Evolutionary artificial neural networks refer to a special class of
   artificial neural networks in which evolution is another fundamental form of
   adapation in addition to learning.
2. In statistics, a statistic is sufficient with respect to a statistical model
   and its associated unknown parameter if "no other statistic that can be
   calculated form the same sample provides any additional information as to the
   value of the parameter.""
3. Bayesian networks are graphical structures for representing the probabilistic
   relationships among a large number of variables. 
4. AI, in particular the field of machine learning, offers a collection of
techniques that can effectively detect patterns in data and has increasingly
demonstrated utility in scientific disciplines. (source: Advancing mathematics

#### Pattern
At the last part of the introduction part, you give an overview of your paper
structure, in which you need some verbs to introduce your work. Some words come
to my mind, but it is not proper, such as *talk about*, the common words are as
the follow:
- brief introduction
- concern, present
- dicuss
I am not a fan of "cover provide show", although they are alternative.


#### Example
1. gain remarkable progress in variety of task: such as speech recognition,
   image recognition, and machine translation. 
2. impressive performance
3. significant progress

####
There are great advantages to recognizing or formulating a problem as a convex
optimization problem. The most basic advantage is that the problem can then be
solved, very reliably and efficiently.  There are also theoretical or conceptual
advantages of formulating a problem as a convex optimization problem.
