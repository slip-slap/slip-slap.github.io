#### if not
1. If not, a simpler method is this: find any fundamental matrix; then y = a + b.

#### if..., and..., then


one of the principles of forecasting, is that the more specific a prediction is,
the more likely it is to be wrong.


#### introduce something
the target, requirment, solution(requitment, solution).
1. **The search strategies** discussed in Section 3 **aim at** finding a neural
architecture X that maximizes some performance measure, such as accuracy on
unseen data. 
2. To guide their search process, these strategies need to estimate the
   performance of a given architecture X under consideration.
3. The simplest way of doing this is to train X on training data and evaluate
   its performance on validation data.

If the offspring dominates the parent, the offspring is accepted as the next
parent and the iteration continues. On the other hand, if the parent dominates
the offspring, the offspring is discarded and a new mutated solution (a new
offspring) is found. However, if the offspring and the parent do not dominate
each other, the choice between the offspring and the parent is made by comparing
them with an archive of best solutions found so far. The offspring is compared
with the archive to check if it dominates any member of the archive. If it does,
the offspring is accepted as the new parent and all the dominated solutions are
eliminated from the archive. If the offspring does not dominate any member of
the archive, both parent and offspring are checked for their nearness with the
solutions of the archive. If the offspring resides in a least crowded region in
the objective space among the members of the archive, it is accepted as a parent
and a copy of added to the archive.
