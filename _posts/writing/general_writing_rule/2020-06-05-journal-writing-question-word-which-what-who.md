#### What and which
*what* and *which* are interchangable in most cases, where *which* is prefered if
the number of choices are limited, and *what* is preferred when the number of
choices is unlimited. For example
- We have got small or large eggs. Which will you have.
- What is your name ?

##### With Nouns
*What* and *Which* can be used to ask questions about both things and people.

- What the fuck are you talking about ?
- What time is it?
- Which teacher do you like best?
