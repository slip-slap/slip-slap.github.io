#### Which
1. Putting a comma preceding which, which makes a sentence simple to read.
- There is only so much that one can do with tangent vectors, which are
  essentially arrows, but functions, far more flexible, can be added,
  multiplied, scalar-multiplied, can composed with other maps.


#### preposition + which
- Another technique in least-squares is regularization, in which extra terms are
added to the cost function.
- Learning approach is the way teacher view the learning process, in which there are learning strategies with all his theories.

##### Remark
Roughly specaking, the function of *Where* is similar to *which* when place it
before a clause, and the difference as follows:
1. *Where* is less formal, *in which* is more formal
2. *Where* is less specific. *At/in/on/to/into which* is more specific. If I
   say, *the cup where I left the spoon, you might look for the spoon lying next
   to, lying across, or resting inside the cup. At which is also less specific*,
   but *on which* means the spoon lies across the cup, and *in which* means it
   rests inside the cup.

#### That
1. I hope that the modesty of the scope allows the central ideas to emerage more clearly.
2. The following examples shows that a function need not be real-analytic.




#### is
1. It is well known that least-squares and linear programming problems have a complete theory.
2. It is used to find bounds on the optimal values.
3. If we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition.


#### is to
1. The central idea behind abstract algebra is to define a larger class of objects.
