#### Why present tense is preferred?
Literary works, paintings, films, and other artistic creations are assumed to exist in an eternal present.
- Therefore, when you write about writers or artists as they express themselves in their work, use the present tense.


#### Basic rule
1. You should use past tense when discussing historical events, and you should use the literary present when discussing events.


#### 1. Commenting on what a writer says, use the present tense.
1. Example: Dunn begins his work with a view into the lives and motivations of the
very first settlers.
