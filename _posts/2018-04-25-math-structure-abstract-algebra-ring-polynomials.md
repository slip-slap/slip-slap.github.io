#### Introduction
 It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring. In this chapter we
 shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial
 rings. We can prove prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to
 the theorems we proved for the integers.  Analogs of prime numbers, the divsion
 algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

#### Notation
1. We will denote the set of all polynomials with coefficients in a ring R by
   $R[x]$

2. Irreducible Polynomials: A nonconstant polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is
   irreducible over a field F if $f(x)$ can not be expressed as a product of two
   polynomials $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ in $F(x)$, where the degrees of $g(x)$ and
   $f(x)$ are both smaller than the degree of $f(x)$.
- Irreducible polynomials function as the "prime numbers" of polynomial rings
