#### Definition
1. Euler Trail: A trail that traverses every edge of G is called an Euler trail
   of G.
2. Tour: A tour of G is a closed walk that traverses each edge of G at least
   once.
3. Euler Tour: An Euler tour is a tour which traverses each edge exactly once.
4. Hamilton path: A path that contains every vertex of G is called a Hamilton
   path of G.
5. Hamilton cycle: a Hamilton cycle of G is a cycle that contain every vertex of
   G.
6. Hamiltonian: A graph is hamiltonian if it contains a Hamilton cycle.


#### Application: Chinese Postman Problem
A postman picks up mail at the post office, delivers it, and then returns to the
post office. He must of course, cover each street in his area at least once.
- subject to this condition, he wishes to choose his route in such a way that he
  walks as little as possible.
