#### HAHA
As we prefer to write operation as addition, so loop is represented by
a+b+c=b+c+a = c+a+b, because it is a closed loop geometry, we call this a **cycle**

#### HAHA
1. chain: is going to be a word for random element in this free abelian group of
random combination  with integer coefficient.
2. boundary: final point minus initial point

#### HAHA
This is an algebraic way to detect whether we have a cycle or not.

#### HAHA
Every Connected graph X has a spanning tree which includes all vertices.
A tree with V vertices always has v-1 edges.


#### HAHA
$$
C_{3} \stackrel{\partial_{3}}{\rightarrow} C_{2}
\stackrel{\partial_{2}}{\rightarrow} C_{1}
\stackrel{\partial_{1}}{\rightarrow} C_{0}
$$
