#### Background
1. We have now constructed the integers, with the operations of addition,
   subtraction, multiplication, and order and verified all the expected
   algebraic and order-theoretic properties. Now we will use a similar
   construction to build the rationals , adding division to our mix of
   operations.



#### Definition
1. A rational number is an expression of the form a//b where a and b are
   integers and b is non-zero; a//0 is not considered to be a rational number.
   Two rational numbers are considered to be equal, $a//b = c//d$, if and only if
   $ad = cb$, the set of all rational numbers is denoted $Q$
