#### Why
There are a few Latin terms that are still commonly used in English scholarly writing.

#### etc.
The abbreviation "etc." is from the Lation word "et alia", which means "and the rest".

#### et al.
It means "and others".

#### e.g.
1. When "e.g." is used, it implies that there are other examples not mention in
   the list. Here are some examples:
- The Summer Olympics is composed of a variety of sports(e.g., gymnastics, swimming, and tennis)
2. It can be used interchangeably with "for example" or "such as".

##### Common mistakes
One common mistake is using with "etc." in the same sentence. Because e.g.
implies that other examples are being omitted.


#### i.e.
I.e. is the abbreviation for the Latin phrase id est, meaning "that is."
This is used when you want to specify something mentioned previously.
- It can be used interchangeably with "specifically" or "namely."

1. Every students should learn the two basic methodologies in the field, i.e.,
   forward genetics and reverse genetics.


#### Others
1. simply add an 's' to an abbreviation to make it plural.
