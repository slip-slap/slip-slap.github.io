#### Definition 
Ring:  A ring is a set of elements under $$\times, -,+$$, not commutative under $$\times$$
- At first, ring is a concept generialize the integer


##### Example
1. Integer: Every Integer is a product of primes.

2. Matrix
 $$2\times 2$$ matrix, $$a,b,c,d \in R \times$$.

$$ 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		a & b \\
		c & d  \\
	\end{bmatrix}
$$
rings generalize matrix, which are pretty important.
3. Intergers  are ring.

#### Polynomial
Polynomials with coefficients
Every Polynimial is a product of irreducible polynomials(instead of prime polynomials) <br />
$$
x^{15}-1=(x-1)\left(x^{2}+x+1\right)\left(x^{4}+x^{3}+x^{2}+x+1\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}{x^{8}-x^{7}+x^{5}-x^{4}}{+x^{3}-x+1}\end{array}\right)
$$


#### Remark
When I begin to learn math, the operation 0 divides a number confuses me a lot. <br />
After talent French mathematician comes out group theory, everything change. In the point of view of group theory, you can treat everything you 
meet as group with additive structure. For example, real numbers under operation addition is a group, totally true.
but you want to add multiply structure to this group, It's Ok, I accept your proposal, and then give it a new name,
we call it a ring.
