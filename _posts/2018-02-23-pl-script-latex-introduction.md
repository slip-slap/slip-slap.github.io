#### 1  Tex and Latex
1. Tex is about formatting 
2. Latex is about content


#### Compiling
Most latex compilers need to be re-run several times in order to get a camera ready copy.
1. if there was a .idx file, remember its content
2. run latex
3. if the .idx file changed due to latex compiler, then run **makeindex** to redo the **.ind** file.
4. if the .aux file generated by the latex contains a \bibdata line, then it means we are using a
   **.bib** file, Therefore, run **bibtex**
5. if the .bbl file changes because of this, then remember to rerun latex.


#### 2. cls and sty
1. .cls files are loaded with **\documentclass{}** command, .cls files are called classes.
-  a class file will complete define the strucutre of a document
- they are mandatory
2. .sty files are loaded with **\usepackage{}** command, .sty files are called style files, or just
   packages.
- package or style file, they are provide something that class files doesn't accommodate, amendment
  to class files, or improvement.
- they are optional


#### 3. .bst file
.bst file is used to specify the bibliography style
