#### Background
1. A polyhedron is the three-dimensional version of a polygon: it is a chunk of
   space with flat walls. In other words, it is a three-dimensional figure make
   by gluing polygons together.
- The word is Greek in origin, meaning many seated. The plural is polyhedra.

2. A regular polygon is a polygon with all its edges equal and all angles equal
- a regular polyhedron is one whose faces are regular polygons, all congruent,
  and having the same number of polygons at each vertex.


#### Definition
1. Angle defect: the angle defect at a vertex of a polygon is defined to be $2
   \pi$ minus the sum of the angles at the corners of the faces at that vertex.
- For instance, at any vertex of a cube there are three angles of $\frac{\pi}{2}$
so the angle defect is $\frac{\pi}{2}$
- You can visualize the angle defect by cutting along an edge at that vertex,
  and then flattening out a neighborhood of the vertex into the plane.
- A little gap will form where the slit is: the angle by which it opens up is
  the angle defect.
