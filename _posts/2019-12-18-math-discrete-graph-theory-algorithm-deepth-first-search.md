#### DFS
DFS stands for Depth First Search is a edge based technique. It used the Stack
data structure, performs two stages:
- first visited vertices are pushed into stack 
- second if there is no vertices then visited vertices are popped.


####
1. class classification


#### Galois
1. DFS just provide us another way to visit all the nodes in a graph.
