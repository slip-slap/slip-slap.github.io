#### What does Kmeans do ?

1. The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K.

<hr />

#### formula

All points with a cluster are closer in distance to their centroid than they are to any other centroid, and the mathematical condition
for the K cluster $$C_{k}$$ and the K centroid $$u_{k}$$ can be expressed as: <br />

$$
\text { Mnimize } \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{\mathbf{x}_{n} \in C_{k}}\left\|\mathrm{x}_{n}-\mu_{k}\right\|^{2} \text { with respect to } C_{k}, \mu_{k}
$$

<hr />

#### Application

1. customer segmentation
2. Document Classification

#### the relationship between EM algorithm and Kmeans
The general EM scheme
1. The E-step, where each object is assigned to the centroid such that it is assigned to the most likely cluster
- **why why why the name is Expectation**, because in this step we assign the
  probability to each observation data, 0 or 1, **then we can calculate the
  expectation of corresponding distribution.**
2. The M-step, where the model(=centroids) are recalculated(least square optimization)
It differs from GMM:
- it uses hard partitioning, each object is assigned to exactly one cluster
- the model are centroids only, no variance or covariance are taken into account
