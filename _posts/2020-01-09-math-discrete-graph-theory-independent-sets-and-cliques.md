#### Concept
1. Independent set: A subset S of V is called an independent set of G if no two
   vertices of S are adjacent in G.
2. Clique: A clique of a simple graph G is a subset S of V such that G[S] is
   complete
- This name **Clique** is very intuitive and informative, in a clique, everyone knows each
  other, in a graph, every vertice is connected to the other vertices in the
  clique.
