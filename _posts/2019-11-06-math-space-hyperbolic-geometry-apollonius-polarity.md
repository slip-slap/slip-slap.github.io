#### Theorem: Polar Independence Theorem
The polar does not depend on the choice of lines through a.
#### Theorem: Pole of A Line Theorem
Every line A which is not a diameter of a circle, is the polar of a unique point a, called the pole
of A.

#### Polarity holds for general conics

#### Harmonic Conjugates

#### Galois
1. In this section, we develop the geometry foundation, in the following we will
   use study this geometry in an algebraic way.
2. the up tack(‚ä•) plays a complementary or dual role in this theory. actually,
   actually, in many theory, this marker plays the complementary or dual role.
