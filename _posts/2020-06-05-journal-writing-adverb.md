#### 1.
We don't use comma to separate single-word adverb from the word they modify.

#### Adverb location
Some of the fun in playing with adverbs is moving them around a sentence.
While adverbs that modify adjectives and other adverbs must come immediately
before the adjective or adverb, there are options when an adverb modifies a
verb. We can put the adverb near the verb, but we don't have to. All of the following cases work.
- Quickly she raced to the hospital.
- She quickly raced to the hospital.
- She raced quickly to the hosptial.
- She raced to the hospital quickly.
