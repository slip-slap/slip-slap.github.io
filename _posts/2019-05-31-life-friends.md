####  The one who sucks

There are two girls in the studio, we can name them A and B. A went to Europe for a trip.
During her holiday,A friend of A, we can name her C, came to our lab as an exchange student. A and C were roommates
when they were bachelor. After they graduated from university, A came to Japan for the master, and C stay in China
for the master degree. Finally, one day A came back, A is a little near-sighted. She walked into the lab, and she saw
a girl sitted on the chair. and A thought the girl is her used roomates. so A run to the girl, hugged her with her arm  
around C,very enthusiastic, and say,"C, I missed you much". You know, I was so shocked, because
the girl who sitted there is B. and B also very confused. that's so awkward.      


#### The one who graduates(2019)
She is good at talking, almost everyone will laugh by the way she talks and behaves. 
She can always make everyone feel so happy. I like her, not as a boyfriend, just as a friend 
She is very smart and so considerable. 
She know how to behave properly in a party, meeting or presentation. She can always make everyone feel so good.
That's not easy. <br />

Sometimes we talked, but only very common subject, like delicious food, beautiful city, how to save transportation
fee, how to get along with professor,something like that, we never tell personal staff to each other, such as parents,
family situation. We kind of just classmates, not friend. Yesterday night, I sitted alone in the studio, and she just 
came back to Japan a few days ago, and sitting there, play around with her ipad, liking drawing the her family member.
I forget how we run into family topic. About three years ago, she owns a very happy family. Her parents relationship 
are so good, and They love each other. Because of some accident, her dad passed away. and her grandpa and grandma favoured
sons over daughter... There are so many misfortune happened on her in recent three years, she cried and talked, I was sitting 
there, not interrupting her, and listening her. I can feel
her pain, I want to hug her, just hug her for a while. <br />

Compare with her misfortune, The things that annoys me is not worth to mention. <br />
We should talk to friends,
