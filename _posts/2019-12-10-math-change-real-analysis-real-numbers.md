#### Background
1. we have rigorously constructed three fundamental number systems:
- The natural number system N, The integers Z and the rational Q.


#### History
1. Limit is a concept on one level is quite intuitive, but to pin down turn out
   to be quite difficult
2. Even the great mathematician Euler and Newton had difficult with this
   concept. It was only until 19th century cauchy figure out how to deal with
   this concept rigorously.


#### Galois
1. You are of course free to design you own number system, possibly including one
division by zero is plausible; but you will have to give up one of the axioms.
