#### Chinese
I am a native Chinese speaker, but I don't think I master this language at all.
Of coures, I understand what people are talking about, every topic, every areaa,
I can tell the small difference when people talk, the words, the tone. But the
problem lies in me is I can't express myself in a very concise and efficient
way. I should master some words in different area.   

In the 21st century, Chinese is the most important language in the world,
because the Chinese powerfull econemy capability, and military ability.

#### English
I have learn English for so many years. Currently, American is the most
powerfull country in the earth, and English is the most popular language, There
is no doubt about that.
I can listen pretty well, I can understand what people are talking about, and I
can express myself. But the problem is I should try to improve my express
capabality, more accurate, more fluent. 

I favour english most, because in the world, english is the most common used
language in the world, for business, for communication, for techology, for
scientist, I should learn english.

Because Japanese language is influenced by Tang Dynasty and American, I can
learn Japanese pretty easily, and the problem lies me is the listening. I should
listen more, and memorize more words.


#### Galois

1. First, you need to memorize words, it's the building blocks.
2. Second, listen, listen, and listen, listen different topics
3. memorize the word that is often used in some specific area.

dynasty. Why Democracy and scitenist are very developed in Greece. I want to
know Napoleon, Alexander, Kublai Khan, Sultan. If you want to talk about movies,
