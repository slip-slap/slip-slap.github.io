#### definition
1. Lebesgue integral: extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.
2. Improper integral: a definite integral that has either or both limits infinite or an intergrand that approaches infinity 


#### Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem
Let $${f\_n}$$ be a sequence of real-valued measurable functions on a measure space. Suppose that the sequence converges pointwise to a function
f and is dominated by some integrable function g in the sense that.
