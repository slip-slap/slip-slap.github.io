#### BFS
BFS stands for Breadth First Search is a vertex based techinique for finding
   a shortest path in graph. 
1. It uses a Queue data structure which follows first in first out. In BFS, one
  vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent
  are visited and stored in the queue. 
- step 1: visiting a vertex
- step 2: exploration

#### Application
1. web crawling
2. social networking
3. network broadcast
4. garbage collection
5. model checking
6. mathematical conjecture checking
7. solving puzzles games

#### galois
1. Graph just as the other abstract data type, why we need to study how to visit node
   in a graph, because things turn a little complicate now, array, stack, tree,
   visiting each element is a very simple things. 
2. BFS is one strategy that we visit every node in the graph, and another thing
   we gain is **the approach to find shortest path from one source to the other
   nodes in the graph**
