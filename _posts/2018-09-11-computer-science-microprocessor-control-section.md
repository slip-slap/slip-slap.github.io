#### Introduction
Every computer has one special bit. All other bits in a computer come from somewhere, they are set
on and off by other bits or switches. 
1. This one special bit turns on and off all by itself. But there is nothing mysteriour about it, it
   just goes on and off very regularly and very quickly.
