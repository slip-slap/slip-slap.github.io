#### friend function


#### friend class





#### Galois
1. At the beginning when I learn C++, one hard part is where I should put the
   keyword, and the reason is I don't understand C++
2. This teacher explain friend in an very elegant way. 
- wirte a function in the class
- write the **keyword friend** in front of the function.
