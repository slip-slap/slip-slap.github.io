#### HAHA
Fundamental group of a surface, which is a very important topic to link topology
and algebra.

#### Definition
In mathematics, a path in topological space X is a continuous function f from
unit interval I=[0,1] to X <br />
$$
f: I \rightarrow X
$$

#### Homotopic path

#### Definition
1. toological space: may be defined as a set of points, along with a set of
   neighbourhoods for each point.
2. In topology, two continuous functions from one topological space to another
   are called homotopic if one can be "continuously deformed into the other,
   such a deformation being called a homotopy between two functions."

3. The most important thing is to convince ourself, this object is realy a
   group.

#### Group
$\pi (m, x_0) $ is a group, with technically mathmatically theory of a group.
1. closed
2. identity element: constant loop, the loop doesn't go anywhere, just stay at
   $x_0$
3. associativity
4. inverse element



#### Galois
Why we are interested in subspace, it's just like the subgroup in the group
theory !!!!!!!!! <br />
These guys are co clever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
