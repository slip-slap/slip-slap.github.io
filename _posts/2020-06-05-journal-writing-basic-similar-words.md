##### As well as
1. As well as cannot be used to mean and. The expression X as well as Y means not only Y but also X.
- As well as places unequal emphasis on the two expressions.
- The expression preceding as well as carries a stronger emphasis than the expression following it.

2. As well as does not make subject plural.

- John, as well as Mary, want to drop the course(incorrect)
3. Verbs after as well as come in ING form.

##### Wrong example
It is therefore wrong to use as well as simply in order to avoid a repetition of and, as in the sentence below.
- The university focuses on education, research and development, as well as
  dissemination. (incorrect if all three areas are equally important and none
  is to be emphasized.)
