#### A
1. 塩を渡してくれませんか。
2. 送ってくれた本もう読みました。
3. 水が欲しい
4. 彼は水が欲しい

In the above example, there aren't words such as "you", I in these sentence. But
these sentences make sense automatically, how? by means to the verb. In japanese
culture, always assumming the subject of the action is the one who speaks, so it
is unnesscary to mention the subject.


#### B
1. ほら見て、飛んでるよ
