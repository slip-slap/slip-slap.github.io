#### Definition
Let G be a group acting on a set X.
1. Fixed Point: A fixed point of an element  $g \in G$ is an element  $x \in X such that $g\cdot
x = x$
2. Stabilier: The stabilizer $G_x$ of a point $x \in X$ is the set of elements
   $g \in G $ such taht x if a fixed point of g.
3. The orbit of an elment $x \in X$ is the set of elements $y \in X$ such that
   $g \cdot x =y$ for some $g \in G$.


#### Definition
1. The action is transitive if there is only one orbit: for any $x,y \in X$,
   there is an element $g \in G$ such that $g \cdot x = y$
2. The action is faithful is the intersection of the stabilizers $G_x$ for $x
   \in X$ consists only of the trivial element $e_G$.
