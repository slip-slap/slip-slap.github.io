#### Background
If H is a subgroup of a group G, then right cosets are not always the same as
left cosets; that is, it is not always the case that $gH=Hg$ for all $g \in G$.
The subgroups for which this property holds play a critical role in group
theory. They allow for the construction of a new class of groups.


#### Definition
1. A subgroup H of a group G is normal in G if $gH = Hg$ for all $g\in G$. That is,
a normal subgroup of group G is one in which the right and left cosets are
precisely the same.

2. Factor Groups: If N is a normal subgroup of a group G, then the cosets of N
   in G from a group $G/N$ under the operation $(aN)(bN)=abN$. This group is
   called the $\textbf{factor}$ or $\textbf{quotient group}$ of G and N.
