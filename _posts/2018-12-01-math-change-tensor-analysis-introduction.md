#### 1. Definition 

##### 1.1  Version one
Tensor is multi-dimensional array of numbers: such as scalar, vector, matrix.

##### 1.2  Version two
Tensor is an object that is invariant under a change of coordinates, and has
components tat change in a special, predictable way under a change of
coordinates
- Like a pencil in space, it doesn't change no matter in which coordinates.

##### 1.3  Version three
Tensor is a collection of vectors and covectors combined together using the
tensor product.
- This is the abstract definition




#### Definition
1. Tensor Fields: If to each point of a region in N dimensional space
   corresponds a definite tensor, we say that a tensor field has been defined,
   This is a vector field or a scalar field according as the tensor is of rank
   one or zero. It should be noted that a tensor or tensor field is not just the
   set of its components in one special coordinates system but all the possible
   sets under any transformation of coordinates.

#### Galois
1. Just like infinitesimal, we redefine a new math object, we give this new
   object a couple of rules.
2. Speak of rules, it remind you in bayesian formula, and the other subject.
- every intimidating objects are out of its basic rules.
3. In the tensor calculus, we give $dx$ another interpretation, base on this
   interpretation and new rules, we redefine everything.
