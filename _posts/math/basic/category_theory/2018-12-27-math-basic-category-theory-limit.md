#### Problem With Construction of A product
1. The Construction of a product starts with the selection of two objects $a$
   and $b$, whose product we want to construct. But what does it mean to $select
   objects?$


#### Galois
1. The intuition is that the limit embodies the properties of the whole diagram
   is a single object.
- For instance, the limit of our two-object diagram is the product of two
  objects. the product(together with the two projections) contains the
  information about both objects. And being universal means that it has no
  extraneous junk.
