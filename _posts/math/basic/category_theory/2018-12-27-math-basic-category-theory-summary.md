#### What's this?
See patterns in math.


#### What's category?
It's all about morphisms.
- If I haven't convinced you yet that category theory is all about morphisms
  then I haven't done my job properly.


#### Galois
1. Human being can only understand things that are well structured, things that
   can be subdivided into the trivial one, studying the properties of these
   trivial things, then composing them together.
2. In programming language, procedural programming, dividing big problems into
   small, solve them. Integral these solution together.
3. In physics, world is consists of  atoms, atoms consists of photon, and
   proton. To some extent, human being can't divide these small beasts
   anymore, we are sad. But we still want to nail it, string theory comes up,
   basically, as the basic component, composing them together, we have the
   world.
3. In topology, number theory, group theory, and so on.
4. Why this, because as a human being, we can only solve problem that are well
   structured, that's our limit and advantage.
5. Our brain can't understand things with a basic struture.
