#### set theory
1. Sample space: there elements in that sample space  
2. events:   events are subsets of the sample space.
3. sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points --from Merriam Webster
4. according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, it's a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.




#### 
1. $X(t,\omega)$
- All these things about stochastic process just about the property of this function.
- if $t$ is fixed, this item refers to a random variable at time $t$.
- if $\omega$ is fixed, this item refers to a sample function.
- Don't treat $\omega$ as only the sample space of one random variable, it's the set of all random variable's sample space.
- Given a random variable, we give a sample. we give every random variable an input, which is the sample space. 
- and all these samples form the sample function.
