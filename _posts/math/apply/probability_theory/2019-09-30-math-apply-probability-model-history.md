#### Interpretation of probability
The concept of probability has a rich and diversified history that includes many
different philosophical approcaches. Notable amont these approaches include the
notions of probability as a ratio, as a relative frequency, and as a degree of
belief.


1. In 1933 A.N. Kolmogorov developed the set-theoretic definition of
   probability, which serves as a mathematical foundation for all applications
   of probability.


#### Remark
Both relative frequency and degree of belief are our intuitives from the real
world, obviously, which are different concept. Can you find an interpretation to
unify these two intuitives. Here is set-theoretic definition to play, which is
more abstract, insightful, and concise. And relative frequnecy and degree of
belief are two implemenation of this definition from two different respective.  
It needs insight to come up with something fundamental, which makes you a great
mathematician.
