#### Geometry intrepretation of probability
The **Bertrand paradox** is a problem within the classical interpretation of
probability theory, as an example to show that the principle of indifference may
not be produce definite, well-defined, results for probabilities if it is
applied uncritically when the domain of possibilities is infinite.


#### Problem
The problem is presented as follows: consider an equilateral triangle inscribed
in a circle. Suppose a chord of the circle is chosen as random. What is the
probability that the chord is longer than a side of the triangle? Bertrand gave
three methods as follows:

1. Random endpoints: Random choose two points on the circle, try to image roatint the triangle so
   its vertex coincides with one of the chord endpoints. Observe that if the
   other chord points lies on the arc between the endpoints of the triangle side
   opposide the first point, the chord is longer than a side of the triangle.
