**Definition:** For $p \in \[0,1\]$, the $pth$ quantile (or 100pth percentile)
$x_p$, for the distribution with cdf $F_X$, is defined to be the smallest number
$x_p$ satisfying $ p \leq F_{X}\left(x_{p}\right) $.

For example, if your mark on a text placed you at the 90th percentile, then you
mark equals $x_{0.9}$ and 90% of your fellow test takers achieved your mark or
lower.
