#### Motivation
We can **LEARN FROM DATA** through Bayes' theorem.




#### Remark
Probability theory and graph theory are get involved in this study, which are
two different subject. Some natural questions are as follows: 
- Does a concept also exists in graph theory which exists in probability theory? 
- suppose it exists, How do we relate the concepts with them? 
- For example, the conditional independence concept? Does it exist in graph
  theory? How are we going to define it? How exactly are they relate to each
  other.
- All the properties we develop in DAG are for probability distribution. 


#### Galois 
1. Why bother a graph? We want to know the relationship, causal relationship or
   correlation relationship,  whatever it is.
