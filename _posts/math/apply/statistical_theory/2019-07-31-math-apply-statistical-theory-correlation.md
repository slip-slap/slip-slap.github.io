**Definition:** The correlation measures the direction and strength of the
linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Correlation is usually
writen as $r$.

Suppose that we have data on variables $x$ and $y$ for $n$ individuals. The
means and standard deviations of the two variables are $\bar{x}$ and $s_x$ for
the x-values, and $\bar{y}$ and $s_y$ for the y-values. The correlation $r$
between x and y is

$$
r=\frac{1}{n-1}
\sum\left(\frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s_{x}}\right)\left(\frac{y_{i}-\bar{y}}{s_{y}}\right)
$$
