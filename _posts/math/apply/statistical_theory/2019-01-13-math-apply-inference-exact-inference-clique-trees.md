#### Concept
1. Cluster Graph: a data structure that provides a graphical flowchart of the
   factor-manipulation process
- a cluster: each node in the cluster graph is a cluster, which is associated
  with a subset of variables
- the graph contains undirected edges that connect clusters whose scopes have
  some nonempty intersection.
