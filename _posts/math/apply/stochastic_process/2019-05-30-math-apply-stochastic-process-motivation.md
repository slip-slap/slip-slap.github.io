#### Relationship with probability theory 
Stochastic process are primarily concerned with how events happen as respect to
time, which is a complete new point of view to events.  In most cases, the
reason stochastic process is closely connected to probabiliy just because
single event is associated with probability theory. The classical stochastic
process are as follows:
1. Poisson process: it is a counting process. counting the events is the purpose
   of poisson process, and poisson distribution just happens to related to this.
2. Renewal process: counting a process in which the interarrival are
   independent.
3. Markov process: we also only care about counting. 
4. Martingales: It is also about counting, and the expected sum of the
   counting is zero.

General speaking, stochastic process is about counting, and human being just
study some special counting process.
