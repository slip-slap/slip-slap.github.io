#### Properties
1. $W_0 = 0$
2. $W$ has indendent increments: for every $t>0$, the future $W_{t+u} - W_{t}$,
   are independent of the past values $W_s$.
3. $W$ has Gaussian increments: $W_{t+u} - W_t$ is normally distributed with
   mean 0 and variance $u$, $ W_{t+u}-W_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, u) $
4. $W$ has continuous paths: $W_t$ is continuous in t
