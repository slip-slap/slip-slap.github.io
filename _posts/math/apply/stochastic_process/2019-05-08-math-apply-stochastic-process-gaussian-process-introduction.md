#### 1. Why
1. Why study linear algebra, because it's simple, and can solve practical problems.
2. Why gaussain distribution, it's simple.
3. Not because it's related to the central limit therom.


#### 2. Property 

##### 2.1 Conditional Distribution

The conditional distribution of $X_1$ given known values for $X_2=x_2$ is a multivariate normal with:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mu_{1}+\Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1}\left(\mathrm{x}_{2}-\mu_{2}\right) \\ 
\Sigma_{11}-\Sigma_{12} \Sigma_{22}^{-1} \Sigma_{21}
\end{array}
$$
