**Example:** Let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be independent, each having the Uniform\[0,1\]
distribution. We write this as $U_1, U_2$ are i.i.d. Uniform\[0,1\]. 

Then define X and Y by

$$
X=\sqrt{2 \log \left(1 / U_{1}\right)} \cos \left(2 \pi U_{2}\right), \quad
Y=\sqrt{2 \log \left(1 / U_{1}\right)} \sin \left(2 \pi U_{2}\right)
$$
