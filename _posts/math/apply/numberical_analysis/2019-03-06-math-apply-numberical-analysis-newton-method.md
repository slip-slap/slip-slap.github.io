#### definition
Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better
approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.  The most basic version
starts with a single-variable function f defined for a real variable x. <br />

1. $tan(\theta) = \frac{f(x_0)}{x_0 - x_1}$
2. $tan(\theta) = f^{\prime}(x_0)$
3. $ x_{1}=x_{0}-\frac{f\left(x_{0}\right)}{f^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)} $
