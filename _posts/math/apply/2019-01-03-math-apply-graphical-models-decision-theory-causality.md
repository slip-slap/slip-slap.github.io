#### 
1. Ideal Intervention:  One approach to modeling causal relationships is using
   the notion of ideal interventions-interventions of the of the form do(Z:=z),
   which force the variable A to take the value z, and have no other immediate
   effect.
2. Intervention Query: 


#### Correlation and Causation
1. In practice, however, there is a huge set of possible latent variables,
   representing factors that exist in the world but that can not observe and
   often are not even aware of. A latent variable may induce correlations
   between the observed variables that do not correspond to causal relations
   between them, and hence forms a confounding factor in our goal of determining
   causal interactions.
