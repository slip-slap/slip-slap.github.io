1. IDSDS: the Iterated Deletion of Strictly Dominated Strategies(IDIDS) is the
   following procedure.

- Any strategy profile that survives the IDSDS procedure is compatible with common knowledge of

#### The Iterated Deletion of Weakly Dominated Strategies(IDWDS)
IDWDS is a weakening of IDSDS in that it allows the deletion of weakly dominated stratedies.
