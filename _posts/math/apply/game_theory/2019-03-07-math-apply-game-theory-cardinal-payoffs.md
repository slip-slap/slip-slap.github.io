#### Terminology
1. lotteries: chance moves gives rise to probablistic outcomes


#### Expect Utility Theory
Let $ O=\left\{o_{1}, o_{2}, \ldots, o_{m}\right\} $ be a set of basic outcomes and $ \mathscr{L}(O)
$ be the set of simple lotteries over $O$. If $ \succsim $ is a von Neumann-Morgenstern ranking of
the element of $\mathsrc{L}(O)$ then there exists a function $U: O \rightarrow R$, called a von
Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. Utility function that assigns a number(called utility) to
every basic outcome and is such that, for any two lotteries 

$ L=\left(\begin{array}{llll}o_{1} & o_{2} & \cdots & o_{m} \\ p_{1} & p_{2} & \ldots &
p_{m}\end{array}\right) $ and $ L^{\prime}=\left(\begin{array}{llll}o_{1} & o_{2} & \cdots & o_{m}
\\ p_{1} & p_{2} & \ldots & p_{m}\end{array}\right) $

- A utility function is a tool that we can use to represent her ranking, nothing more than that.

#### Normalized Utility Function
1. Let $U:O \rightarrow R$ be a utility function that represents a given von Neumann-Morgenstern
   ranking $\succsim$ of the set of lotteries $\mathsrc{L}(O)$, We say that U is normalized if
   $U(o_{\text{worst}}) = 0$ and $U(o_{\text{best}}) = 1$

#### Comment
"Rationality" does not, and should not, dictate whether an individial should be risk neutral, risk
averse or risk loving;
- An individual's attitude to risk is merely a reflection of that individual's preferences
- According to this principle, there is no such thing as an irrational preference and thus there is
  no such thing as an irrational attitude to risk.
- From an empirical point of view, however, most people reveal through their choices that they are
  risk averse, at least when the stakes are high.
