#### Motivation
1. The fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ is especially useful when studying spaces of
   low dimension, as one would expect from its definition which involves only
   maps from low-dimensional spaces into $X$.

#### Terminology 
As we prefer to write operation as addition, so loop is represented by
a+b+c=b+c+a = c+a+b, because it is a closed loop geometry, we call this a **cycle**

1. chain: is going to be a word for random element in this free abelian group of
random combination  with integer coefficient.
2. boundary: final point minus initial point

- This is an algebraic way to detect whether we have a cycle or not.
