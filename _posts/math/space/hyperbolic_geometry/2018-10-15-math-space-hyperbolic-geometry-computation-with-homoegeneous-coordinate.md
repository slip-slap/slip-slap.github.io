#### Definition
1. **Hyperbolic Point**: A hyperbolic point is a proportion $a \equiv [x:y:z]$ of rational numbers in
   square brackets.
2. **Hyperbolic Line**: A hyperbolic line line is a proportion $L \equiv (l:m:n)$
   of rational numbers in round brackets.
3. **Points Lies on Line**: A point $a \equiv [x:y:z]$ lies on the line $L \equiv (l:m:n)$,
    $$
    \Leftrightarrow
    $$ $lx+my-nz=0$
4. Special points and line on the geometry. <br />
   Point p= [1:2:0] <br />
   Line  l=(0:0:3)  which stands for 0x+0y=3, which meaningless, however, we can
   deal with this in three dimensional space, which is 0x+0y-3z=0, which is
   horizontal plane, which is the line at infinity. 




#### Formula
$$
J\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\right) \equiv\left(y_{1}
z_{2}-y_{2} z_{1}: z_{1} x_{2}-z_{2} x_{1}: x_{2} y_{1}-x_{1} y_{2}\right)
$$
<br />
$$
j\left(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}\right) \equiv\left(y_{1}
z_{2}-y_{2} z_{1}: z_{1} x_{2}-z_{2} x_{1}: x_{2} y_{1}-x_{1} y_{2}\right)
$$

where round bracket denote line with captial letter, squre brackets denote point
with small letter.


#### Application to Cartesian Geometry


#### Galois
1. In this section, we introduce homogeneous coordinate, just as in Euclidean
   geometry, the Cartesian coordinate is introduced.
