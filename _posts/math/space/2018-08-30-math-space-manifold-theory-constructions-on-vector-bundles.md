#### Background
1. A good way to think of vector bundles are as families of vector spaces indexed
over a base space, All construction we wish to perform on the individual vector
spaces should conform with the indexation in that they should be allowed to vary
continuously or smoothly from point to point.

2. This means, the "natural" constructions are know from linear algebra have
   their counterparts for bundles
