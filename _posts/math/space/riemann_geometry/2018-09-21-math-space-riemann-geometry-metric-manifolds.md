#### Introduction
We introduce a structure on a smooth manifold that allows to assign vectors in each 
tangent space a length and angle between vectors in the same tangent space, also called
inner product structure.


#### Definition 1: Metrics
A metric on a smooth manifold $$(M,O,\mathscr{A})$$ is a (0,2)-tensor field.
