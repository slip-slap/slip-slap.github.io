#### Inspiration
1. Homeomorphism is a very good quality, topological spaces which are
   homeomorphism, simply put, are the same. We like homeomorphism.
2. Homotopy provides a way to study homeomorphism.



#### Claim
1. if two spaces are homeomorphic, then they are homotopy equivalent.


#### Theorem
If $X$ and $Y$ are path-connected spaces such that $ X \sim Y $, then the
fundamental groups $ \pi_{1}(X) $ and $ \pi_{1}(Y) $ are isomorphic.
