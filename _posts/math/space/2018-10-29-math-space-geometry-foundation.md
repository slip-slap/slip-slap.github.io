#### Introduction
1. Geometry, like arithmetic, requires for its logical development only a small
   number of simple, fundamental principles.
2. These fundamental principles are called the axioms of geometry.


3. The following investigation is a new attempt to chooose for geometry a simple
   and complete set of independent axioms and to deduce from these the most
   important geometrical theorems in such a manner as to bring out as clearly as
   possible the significance of the different groups of axioms and the scope of
   the conclusions to be derived from individual axioms.


#### Galois
1. What is geometry? According to Klein, he considered geometry to be the study
of properties that are left uninvariant under transformation groups.
