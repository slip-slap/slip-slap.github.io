#### Background
1. If you take a flat piece of paper and bend it gently, it bends in only one
   direction at a time. At any point on the paper, you can find at least one
   direction through which there is a straight line on the surface. you can bend
   it into a cyclinder, or into a cone, but you can never bend it without
   crumpling or distorting to the get a portion of the surface of a sphere.


2. If you take the skin of a sphere, it can not be flattedned out into the plane
   without distortion or crumpling. This phenomenon is familiar from orange
   peels or apple peels. Not even a small area of the skin of a sphere can be
   flattened out without some distortion, although the distortion is very small
   for a small piece of the sphere. That's why rectangular maps of small areas
   of the earth work pretty well, but maps of larger areas are forced to
   have considerable distortion.

#### Inspiration
1. The physical descriptions of what happens as you bend various surfaces
   without distortion do not have to do with the topological properties of the
   surface. Rather, they have to do with the intrinsic geometry of the surfaces.
   The intrinsic geometry has to do with geometric properties which can be
   detected by measurements along the surface, without considering the space
   around it.


2. There is a mathematical way to explain the intrinsic geometric property of a
   surfae that tells when one surface can or cannot be bent into another.
- the mathematical concept is called the Gaussian curvature of a surface.
- This kind of curvature is not to confused with the curvature of a curve.
- The curvature of a curve is an extrinsic geometric property, telling how it is
  bend in the plane, or bent in space.
- Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic geometric property: it stays the same no
  matter how a surface is bent, as long as it is not distorted.
