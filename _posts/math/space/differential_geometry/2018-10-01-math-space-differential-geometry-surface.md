#### Introduction
1. View1: algebraic surfaces
2. View2: parametrized surfaces
3. It is very important to have a balanced view between these two aspects; most texts are oriented,
following Gauss, to the parametrical side.

#### Special Surface
Non-orientable surface, projective plane, Klein bottle.

#### Topological classification of smooth(orientable) 2-manifolds.


#### Classification
1. cissoid:


#### manifold
differential geometry, algebraic topology overlap field.
