#### Question
1. Why it is called differential geometry?
- because for some geometry object, it can be presented in differential form
  $\frac{d q}{dt} = F(q(t),t)$, we want to study this object, just based on the
  differential equation 
- Trashed the coordinate system.


#### Reference
1. An excellent reference for the classical treatment of differential geometry
   is the book by Struik
2. The more descriptive guide by Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen is also highly
   recommended. This book covers both geometry and differential geometry
   essentially without the use of calculus.
3. It contains many interesting results and gives excellent descriptions of many
   of the constructions and results in differential geometry.
