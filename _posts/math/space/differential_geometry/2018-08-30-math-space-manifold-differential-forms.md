#### Background
Differential forms are generalizations of real-valued functions on a manifold.
- Instead of assigning to each point of the manifold a number, a differential
  k-form assigns to each point a k-covector on its tangent space. 
- For k=0 and 1, differential k-forms are functions and covector fields
  respectively.


#### Inspiration
Differential forms play a crucial role in manifold theory. 
- First and foremost, they are intrinsic objects associated to any manifold, and
  so can be used to construct diffeomorphism invariants of a manifold.
- In constrast to vector fields, which are also intrinsic to a manifold,
  differential forms have a far richer algebraic structure. Due to the existence
  of the wedge product, a grading, and the exterior derivative.

#### Exterior Derivative
In contrast to undergraduate calculus, where the basic objects of study are
functions, the basic objects in calculus on manifolds are differential forms.
**Our program now is to learn how to integrate and differentiate differential
forms**
