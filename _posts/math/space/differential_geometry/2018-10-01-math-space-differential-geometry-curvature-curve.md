#### Goal
1. We saw that arclenght measures how far a curve is from being stationary.
2. Our preliminary concept of curvature is that it should measure how far a
   curve is from being a line.

#### A
1. For a planar curve the idea used to be to find a circle that best
   approximates the curve at a point(just like a tangent line is the line that
   best approximates the curve)
2. The radius of this circle then gives a measure of how the curve bends with
   larger radius implying less bending.
3. Huygens did quite a lot to clarify this idea for fairly general curves using
   purely geometric considerations(no calculus) and applied it to the study
   involutes and evolutes.
