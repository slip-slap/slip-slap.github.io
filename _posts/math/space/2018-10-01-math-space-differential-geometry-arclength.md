#### Background
1. One way of measuring the arclength geometrically is by imaging the curve as a
   thread that can be stretched out and measured. This, however, doesn't really
   help in formulating how it should be measured mathematically
2. Archimedes succeeded in understanding the arclength of circles by relating it
   to the area of the circle
3. The idea of measuring the length of general curves is relatively recent,
   Newton was the first to give the general definition that we should use.
