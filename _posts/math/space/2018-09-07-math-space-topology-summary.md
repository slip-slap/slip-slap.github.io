#### Motivation
1. The central to the study of topology is the homeomorphism between spaces.



#### Galois
1. For the long way in topolgy world, we only want to do one thing, the
   invariant.
2. What's the intrinsic characteristic of a topology?
- Based on our intuition, maybe it's the number of holes.
- Research got more insightfull understanding about how to express the concept
  of hole in a surface, and it is fundamental group.
