#### Timeline
1. Johann Bolyai developed absolute geometry, a geometry that includes both Euclidean geometry and
   hyperbolic geometry.

- Gauss claimed he is  the first guy who found Non-Euclidean Geometry, but he keep this to himself,
  never told anybody. you may say he is perfectism, but maybe he just selfish. Later on, Bolyai
  found Non-Euclidean geometry, to study his paper, Gauss learn Russian language.

#### Galois
1. When geometers first realised they were working with something other than the standard Euclidean
   geometry, they described their geometry under many different names. Felix Klein gave the subject
   the name hyperbolic geometry
