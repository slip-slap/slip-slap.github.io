#### Background
1. The earth is round, this may at one point have been hard to believe, but we
   have grown accusomed to it even though our everyday experience is that the
   earth is (fairly flat)
2. The most effective way to illustrate it  is by maps: a globe is a very neat
   device, but its global character makes it less than practical if you want to
   represent fine details.

#### Problem
1. Locally you can represent things by means of "charts", but the global
   character can't be represented by one single chart. You need an entire atlas,
   and you need to know how the charts are to be assembled, or even better: the
   charts overlap so that we know how they all fit together
2. The mathematical framework for working with such situations is manifold
   theory

#### Inspiration
1. A manifold is a generalization of curves and surfaces to higher dimensions
