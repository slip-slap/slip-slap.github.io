#### Why people care about graph?
1. Why does graph matter?
- Because it implies essence in the universe.
- A line, a geodesic, derivative, are really exists, which means the nature of the world.
- So is the graph, we can represent it in a plane.

2. Graph is a set of anything with any notion of connection. We represent those
   things with dots, those connection with lines.
- Neurons connected by synapses.
- Facebook accound connected by friendships.


#### Essence
There are two aspects we need to study about a graph, the node and the edge.
1. the attribute of the nodes, we have breadth first search and deep first
   search.
2. about the attributes, we have shortest path problem.


#### Galois
1. graph are just like numbers, they exists, really!
