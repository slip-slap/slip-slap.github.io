1. Edge: A directed link, such as $X \rightarrow Y$, represents an edge, and we
   will call it an edge.
2. Given the edge $X \rightarrow Y$, we say the tail of the edge is at $X$ and
   the head of the edge is $Y$.
We also say the following:
- A chain $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ is a **head-to-tail meeting**, the
  edges meet **head-to-tail** at $Z$, and $Z$ is a **head-to-tail** node on the
  chain.
