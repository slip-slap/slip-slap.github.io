#### Concept
1. K-edge Colouring: A k-edge colouring $\mathscr{C}$ of a loopless graph G is
   an assignment of k colours,$1,2,\cdots,k$  to the edges of G. The colouring
   $\mathscr{C}$ is proper if no two adjacement edges have the same colour.
2. G is k-edge colourable if G has a proper k-edge-colouring
