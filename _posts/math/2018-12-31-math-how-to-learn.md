#### Step 1: definition
1. first is definition, it's just a math object. 
- group
- trigonometry
- probability model
- morphism
- tensor
In every subject, basic definition is came up, then you study this object.

#### Step 2: relation

relations means how to compare things, how to compose them

- in affine geometry, only math object is parallel, how to use this basic object
  to bisect a segment, how to compose new things
- in category theory, only to construct more complicate concept with basic
  morphism, universal construction.


#### Galois
Mathematics is a way of representation of our understanding of the world, such
as the concept, how one variable varies along with another, represented by the
function. The we use some symbols to refer this concept. In nature, math is a
tool of represenation. And it's the best way we found to know the world.  By
far, the most difficult subject that I know is Riemman geometry, which
generalize our understanding in three dimensional space, coin intractable
terminology to refer to them, and use mathematical symbols to represent our
understanding.

The routine is as follows:
- We have some idea.
- We use mathematical sysbol to represent this idea.
Is there anything that great with the mathematics, no, it's just a representation.
