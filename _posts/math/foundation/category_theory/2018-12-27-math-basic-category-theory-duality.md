#### Terminology
1. Duality is a very important  property of categories because it doubles the
productivity of every mathematician working in category theory.
- For every construction you come up with, there is its opposite;
- For every theorem you prove, you get one for free.

2. The construction in the opposite category are oftern prefixed with "co"
- so you have products and coproducts, 
- monads and comonads
- cones and cocones
- limits and colimits
- There are no cocomonads though, because reversing the arrows twice gets us
  back to the original state.
