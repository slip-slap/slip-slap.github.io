#### Inspiration
The ancient greek playright once said: "every man is like the company he is wont
to keep"
- If we want to single out a particular object in a category, we can only do
  this by describing its pattern of relationships with other objects(and
  itself). 
- These relationships are defined by morphisms.

#### Definition
There is a common construction in category theory called the universal
construction for defining objects in terms of their relationships
- One way of doing this is to pick a pattern, a particular shape constructed
  from objects and morphisms, and look ofr all its occurrences in the category.
- If it's a common enough pattern, and the category is large, chances are you'll
  have lots and lots of hits. 
- The trick is to establish some kind of ranking among those hits, and pick what
  could be considered the best fit.
