#### Why bother?
The motivation behind every subject is to find the truth, such as, math,
physics, biology, each of them is to know a specific domain of the world.
Philosophy is all about language. 

- Language is a tool, as a tool, the first question is the limit of this tool?
  What does it can do? what does it can't do?
