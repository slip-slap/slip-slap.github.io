#### Definition
1. 1870 According to Cantor: A set is a collection of distinct or well-defined
objects
2. Problems: what kind of objects.
For example: <br />
$u=\{all sets \}=\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\},u,\{4,5\},...\}$ <br />
But this absolutely a logical paradoxy. **u contains u, what are you talking
about**
3. I don't buy set theory.


#### Set Notation
1. Capital letter denotes **a set**, corresponding lower-case letter is used to
   denote an element in the set.
