#### Set Theory
1. Mathematics is of any interest can be explained in terms of sets, functions, and
relations.
- In real analysis, function is defined.
- In group theory, function is defined to study relationship among groups, a new
  terminology is coined which is homeomorphism to generalize the concept of
  function.
- In topology, we want to study the relationship among different surfaces, how
  to map from one surface to another, in nature, it's still function. we still
  call this homeomorphism.

2. Actually, many terminology is used to describe the properties of the mapping.
- Real analysis, surjective, injective, bijective
- Group theory, fixed point, stabilier, and orbit also used to describe the
  properties of a map.
- In topology, homotopy.
