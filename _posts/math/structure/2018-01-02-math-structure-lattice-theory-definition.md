#### Definition
1. Lattice: An order $(L;\leq)$ is a lattice if $sup\{a,b\}$ and $inf\{a,b\}$
   exist for all $a,b \in L$
- In other words, lattice theory singles out a special type of order for
  detailed investigation
- To make such a definition worthwhile, it must be shown that this class or
  orders is a very useful class, that there are many such orders in various
  branches of mathematics(analysis, topology, logic, algebra, geometry, and so
  on)
