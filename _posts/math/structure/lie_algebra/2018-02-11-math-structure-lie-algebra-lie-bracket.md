#### Inspiration
1. math is a language based our intuition, generalize this intuition or analogue
2. The inspriation of Lie Bracket, as fas as I am concerned, is from the cross
   product
3. Cross product which has bilinear property, skew symmetry and Jacobi
   indentiy property.



#### Definition
1. A finite-dimensional real or complex Lie Algebra is a finite-dimensional real
   or complex vector space $ \mathfrak{g} $, together with a map $
   [\cdot, \cdot] \text { from } \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g}
   $ into $ \mathfrak{g} $, with the following properties:
- $[\cdot, \cdot]$ is bilinear.
- $[\cdot, \cdot]$ is skew symmetris: [X,Y] = -[Y,X] for all $X,Y \in \mathfrak{g}$ 
- The Jacobi identity holds: 
$
[X,[Y, Z]]+[Y,[Z, X]]+[Z,[X, Y]]=0
$
for all $X,Y, Z \in \mathfrak{g}$


#### Galois
1. The tangent space $T_e G$ with the bracket is called the Lie algebra of the
   Lie group G.
