####  Property

a \equiv b(\bmod n)

#### Galois
1. How does this idea be come up with? 
- Equal is a very strong concept, congruence just a weak version of equality.
- And we know, equality is a very important concept.
- In number thoery, the congruence of integer is one insight that mathematican
  noticed.
-  Group also an insight, you must have insight, new idea.

2. Equality just a relation between two math object, there is nothing special
   about this concept.
- Congruence has the same properties as equality, but act like in a very
  different way.
