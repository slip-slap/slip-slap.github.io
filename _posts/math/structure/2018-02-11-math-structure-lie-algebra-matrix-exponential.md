#### Definition
If X is an $n \times n$ matrix, we define the exponential of $X$, denoted by
$e^{X}$ or $exp X$, bu the usual power series
$
e^{X}=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{X^{m}}{m !}
$
- Where $X^0$ is defined to be the identity matrix $I$ and where $X^m$ is the
  repeated matirx product of X with itself.



#### Terminology
1. GL(N,R): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is real number 
2. GL(N,C): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is complex number 
3. GL(N,Q): general linear group, n-dimensional, The field is quaternion number 
<br />

1. Operation: I said it's a group, I should tell you the group operation. The 
operation are matrix multiplication.
2. Element: All invertible $N \times N$ matrices with entries from corresponding
   field.


####  Definition
$$
\begin{array}{l}{N_{(+,\cdot)} e_{n}} \\ {(,) \text{   }  \mathbb{F}}\end{array}
$$
A Vector space, given the basis unit, a certain field, vector space scalar and
multiplication, inner product. That's all we need for a vector space.


#### Galois
1. The relationship between Lie group and Lie Algebra, first, we have Lie group,
   and we want to study the properties of Lie group, so we call it lie algebra.
- Why we have this thing? How this come out?

2. What's the original idea behind all this crap?
- because we can treat a $su(3)$ as an geometry, general speaking, a manifold.
- A manifold is an object, we want to find a line through this manifold, oh my
  god, this is so abstract
- How to find the line? With this line we can connect the dots, put everything
  together.
- Mathematician use analogue, they are amazing!!! Full respect.
