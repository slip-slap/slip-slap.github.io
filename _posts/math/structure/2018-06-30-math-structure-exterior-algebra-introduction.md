algebraic system whose product is the exterior product.


#### Definition
1. The kth exterior power of V, denoted $ \Lambda^{k}(V) $, is the vector
   subspace of $ \Lambda (V) $ spanned by elements of the form 
- $
x_{1} \wedge x_{2} \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{k}, \quad x_{i} \in V, i=1,2, \ldots,
k
$
