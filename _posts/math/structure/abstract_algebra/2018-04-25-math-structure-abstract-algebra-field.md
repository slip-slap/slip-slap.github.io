#### Background
It is natural to ask whether or not some field contained in a larger field. 
- We think of rational numbers, which reside inside real numbers.
- In turn, the real numbers live inside the complex numbers.
- We can study the relationship between Q and R, inquire the nature of these
  fields.


#### Definition 
1. Extension Field: A field E is an extension field if f is a subfield of E.
A field is a set F which is closed under two operations + and $\times$
1. F is an abelian group under +
2. F-{0} (The set F without additive identity 0) is an abelian group under
   $\times$
