#### Problem
Given a complex number $z$, what's the meaning of $e^z$?
1. Does it make sense ? It doesn't make any sense. 
2. We can left this undefined, but just think about this
$
e(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{n}}{n !}
$ in real number domain.

- Can we just replace z with complex number in the right part of this equation?
- of course, we can, but how about the right part of this equation.
- It's reasonable, we just replace with complex number too.





#### Galois
1. When study lie algebra, the way to expand the exponential functions is still
   the same.
