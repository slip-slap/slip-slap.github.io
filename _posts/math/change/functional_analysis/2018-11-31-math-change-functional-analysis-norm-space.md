#### Norm Space
A normed vector space is a vector space over the real or complex numbers, on which a norm is defined. 
1. The zero vector, 0, has zero length; every other vector has a positive length.
2. Multiplying a vector by a positive number changes its length without changing its direction.
3. The triangle inequality holds, That is, taking norms as distances, the distance from point A through B to C is never shorter than going
directly from A to C, or the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line.


#### origin
structure of math on a plane
1. set structure
2. algebra structure:   multiplication and addition
3. topology: euclidean distance

#### Banach Space
Banach space: a complete normed vector space. a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of 
vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges
to a well defined limit that is within the space.


#### Geometry Structure of Norm Space
1. subspace
2. Riez theorem
