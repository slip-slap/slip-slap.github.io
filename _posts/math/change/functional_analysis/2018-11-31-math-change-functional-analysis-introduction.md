#### open set 
1. In 2-dimensional plane coordinate, we have distance concept, which is very eazy to understand.
2. According to this concept, we can define continuity <br />
$$
|x-x_{0}|<\delta |f(x)-f(x_{0})|<\varepsilon
$$
This rule can be applied to n-dimensional space, so we can define open ball
3. we abstract the open ball concept as open set
4. open set can be further abstracted to topology concept
5. So mapping from open set to open set is the core of math, and now we can discard the initial distance concept.
