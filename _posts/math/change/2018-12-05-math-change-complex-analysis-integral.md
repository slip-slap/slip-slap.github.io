#### Background
Recall the definition of Riemann Integral

$$
\(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) d x \equiv \lim _{\max \Delta x_{k} \rightarrow 0}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} f\left(x_{k}^{*}\right) \Delta x_{k}\)
$$


- Can we just replace the variable with complex number? 
- of course we can.
- after the lower bound and upper bound are replaced by complex number,
  something very weired comes out.
- There are numberous integral path from complex number $a$ to complex number $b$,
how to deal with this.
- very simple, choose one path.






#### Cauchy-Goursat Theorem
This theorem states if a function is analytic at all points interior to and on a
simple contour C, then the value of the integral of the function around that
contour is zero.
