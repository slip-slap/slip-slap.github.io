#### Background
1. f(x,y) = (u,v) where u = u(x,y) and v = v(x,y)
2. f(z) = w where z and w are complex numbers
What's the difference between the equations above ? No difference at all.
We can do conformal mapping with complex number ?
- The reason we need this because comlex numbers give us some advantage when we
  do comformal mapping.
- Conformal mappling doesn't belong to complex number, just based on the
  properties of complex number, we can do conformal mapping better.




 




#### Note
1. conformal: leaving the size of the angle between corresponding curves
   unchanged \<conformal transformation\>
