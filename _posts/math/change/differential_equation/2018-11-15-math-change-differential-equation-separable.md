#### Definition
A separable differential equation for the function y is

$
	h(y)y^{\prime} = g(t) \textstyle{,}
$

where $h,g$ are given functions.

##### Remark
A separable differential equation has the following properties:
1. the left-hand side depends only on y, so any t dependence is through y.
2. the right-hand side depends only on t.
3. And the left-and side is of form (something on y) $\times y^{\prime}$
