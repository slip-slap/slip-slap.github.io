#### Inspiration
The idea of the Riemann integral is to try to integrate a function by first
majorizing or minorizing that function by a piece constant function(which we
already know how to integrate)

#### Definition
Let $f: I \rightarrow R$ be a bounded function on a bounded interval I.
$
\int_{I} f=\bar{\int}_{I} f
$
then we say that f is Riemann integrable on I and define

$
\int_{I} f:=\int_{I} f=\bar{\int}_{I} f
$


#### Remark
Compare this definition to the relationship between the lim sup, lim inf, and
limit of a sequence $a_n$. The lim sup is always greater then or equal to the
lim inf, but they are only equal when sequence converges, and in this case they
are both equal to the limit of the sequence.
