#### Elements in a Computational Graph

1. Variables
2. Placeholders
3. Constants
4. Operations
5. Graph: A graph is like a central hub that connects all the variables,
   placeholders, constants to operations
6. Session: A session creates a runtime in which operations are executed and
   Tensors are evaluated. It also allocates memory and holds the values of
   intermediate results and variables
