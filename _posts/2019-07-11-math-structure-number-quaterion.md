#### definition
Quaternion are a number system that extends the complex numbers. A feature of
quaternions is that multiplication of two quaternons is noncommutative.
Quaternions are generally represented in the form: <br />
$
a+b \mathbf{i}+c \mathbf{j}+d \mathbf{k}
$
where a,b,c and d are real numbers, and i,j, and k are the fundamental
quaternion units. The quaternions were the first **noncommutative division 
algebra** to be discovered.

1. Quaternion is denoted by H, in order to honour Hamilton


#### Octonions
1. Octonions are a normed division algebra over the real numbers.
2. They are nonassociative


#### Galois
1. we have to go to the four dimensional algebra to understand rotation in
   three-dimensional space, 
2. complex is real hard to understand, isn't it? Yes, it's hard, but you can
   take the complex number in the following view.
3. Complex is number which used to deal with two dimensional vector in algebrac
way. <br />
A Vector $\vec{0,3} \times i^2 = \vec{0,-3}$, the result means the vector rotate
180 degree. This is in algebrc way to handle with vector, not in linear
algebraic way, This is interesting, because we can deal with vector in an
algebraic way. 
4. The question is now we can deal with two dimensional vector, how can we deal
   with three-dimensional vector in algebraic way. the answer is quaternion.
