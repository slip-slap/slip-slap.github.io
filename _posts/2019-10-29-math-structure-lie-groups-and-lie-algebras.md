#### Normed Division Algebra
1. There are only four normed division algebra, which are Real numbers, Complex
numbers, Quaterion, Octonions. 
2. Vector space are only defined over field.


#### Algebra
1. A field has to have a norm to form an algebra, a norm is always great then
   zero.
2. Given a norm, we can have some topology.


#### Notation
1. $S_n$: short for symmetry groups

#### Therom
Every finite group(gp) G is a subgroup of $S_n$ (for some n)
