#### Introduction
Recursive-descent parsing is a top-down method of syntax analysis in which a set of recursive
procedures is used to process the input.
- One procedure is associated with each nonterminal of a grammar
- predictive parsing is a simple form of recursive-descent parsing, called predictive parsing, in
  which the lookahead symbol unambiguously determine the flow of control through the procedure body
  for each nonterminal.
- 


#### Property
1. Predictive parsing relies on information about the first symbols that can be generated by a
   production body.
- More precisely, let $\alpha$ be a string of grammar symbols(terminals and/or nonterminals).
- We define FIRST($\alpha$) to be the set of terminals that appear as the first symbols of one or
  more strings of terminals generated from $\alpha$

2. $\epsilon$-productions
- the predictive parser uses an $epsilon$-production as a default when no other production can be
  used
