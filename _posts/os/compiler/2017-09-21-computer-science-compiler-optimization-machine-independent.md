#### History
1. Code Optimizations: Elimination of unnecessary instructions in object code, or the replacements of one sequence of
  instructions by a faster sequence of instructions that does the same thing is usually called "code
  improvement" or "code optimization."
- High-level languages constructs can introduce substantial run-time overhead if we naively translate
each construct independently into machine code.
