You need have a git soul when you use git.


You are not in a default file system, it's new, and complete different.

You go to file source, copy it to the destination when you use the classic file
system, in which the source is a directory.

In git, you still go to the source when you want get something back, but it is
not a directory any more, it's a commit. you go to a commit, and you get
something back. Keep that in mind.

Thinking things differently is realy a beautiful thing.
