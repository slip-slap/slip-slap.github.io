#### Keywords
1. Subject: It is considered as the keeper of information, of data or of
   business logic
2. Register/Attach: Observers register themselves to the subject because they
   want to be notified when there is a change.
3. Event: Events act as a trigger int the subject such all the obervers are
   notified
4. Nofify: Depending on the implementation, the subject may "push" information
   to the observers, or, the observers may "pull" if they need information from
   the subject.

5. Update: Observers update their state independently from other observers
   however their state might change depending on the triggered event.
