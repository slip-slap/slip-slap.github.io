#### Terminology
1. root
2. parent
3. child
4. descendents
5. siblings
6. ancestors
7. degree of nodes
8. internal nodes, external nodes
8. terminal nodes, nonleaf nodes
9. levels: count node
10. height: count edge

####
1. left skewed tree
2. strict binary tree or proper/complete binary tree


#### binary tree
1. a node has 0, 1, or 2 children.
2. Heights and nodes
- min Nodes n=h+1
- max Nodes $n = 2^{h+1}- 1$
- $log\_2^n - 1 \leq h \leq n-1$
- deg(0) = deg(2)+1
3. strict binary tree: node has o or 2 children.

#### n-ary tree
1. n-ary tree: a tree with each node  has no more than n children.
- 2-3 tree: each node has 0,1,2 or 3 children. 
- 2-3-4 tree: each node has 0,1,2,3 or 4 children
2. strict n-ary tree: each node has 0 or n chldren.
