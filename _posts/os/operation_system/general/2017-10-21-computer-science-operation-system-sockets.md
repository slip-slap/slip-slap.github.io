####
1. A Socket is defined as an endpoint for communication
2. A pair of process communicating over a network employ a pair of sockets-one
   ofr each process
3. A socket is identified by an IP address concatenated with a port number.
4. The server waits for incoming client requests by listening to a specified
   port. Once a request is received, the server accepts a connection from the
   client socket to complete the connection.




#### Galois
1. For a long time, socket is a very mysterious thing for me, it's just code for
   communication.
