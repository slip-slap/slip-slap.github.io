#### Linux and BSD

+ Linux is just the Linux Kernel. A typical Linux distributions are made of many pieces of software.
That's why linux is sometimes called GNU/Linux. There are many linux distributions, like Redhat,Ubuntu,Debian,
if you want to install Linux, you will need to choose among the linux distributions first

+ BSDs are both a kernel and an operating system. For example, FreeBSD provides both the BSD kernel and the operating system. 
+ Both of Linux and BSDs are compilant with POSIX standard.

### Mac OS X, Linux, and BSD

+ Mac OS X distribution is based on BSD kernel and BSD operationg system. The command line in the Mac OS X is not as powerful as GNU/linux.
+ Although both of them are compilant with POSIX standard, the grammar are little different. GNU/linux seems more simple and powerfull. so
you should replace Mac OS X utilities with GNU core utilities.
