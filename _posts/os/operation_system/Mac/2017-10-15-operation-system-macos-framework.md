#### Question: what are Frameworks?
1. A *framework* is a hierarchical directory that encapsulates shared resources, such as a
dynamic shared library, nib files, image files, localized strings, head files, and reference
documentation in a single package.
- It just a more sophiscated library, and head files.

2. A bundle is a directory in the file system that groups executable code and related resources 
such as image and sound together in one place.



#### Galois
1. The reason I prefer MacOS is that it derives from linux, which is
   open-source. Then I think I know what happens in there. 
2. However, no matter which platform you choose, you need to know your system:
   the available interface, and where you are.
3. For example, you want to develop a desktop application, then you need MacOS
   SDK, which is bundled with XCode.
