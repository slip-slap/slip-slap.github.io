#### Question: what are Frameworks?
1. A *framework* is a hierarchical directory that encapsulates shared resources, such as a
dynamic shared library, nib files, image files, localized strings, head files, and reference
documentation in a single package.
- It just a more sophiscated library, and head files.

2. A bundle is a directory in the file system that groups executable code and related resources 
such as image and sound together in one place.
