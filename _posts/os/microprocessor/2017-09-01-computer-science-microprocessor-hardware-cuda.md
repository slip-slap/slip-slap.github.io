1. CUDA: cuda short for compute unified device architecture is a parallel
   computing and application programming interface model, It allows developers
   to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit(GPU) for general purpose
   processing - an approach termed GPGPU(General computing on Graphics
   Processing Units).
