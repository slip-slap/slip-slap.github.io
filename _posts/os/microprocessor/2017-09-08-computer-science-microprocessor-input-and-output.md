#### Introduction
All we need for I/O is a few wires, and a new instruction.
1. For the wires, all we are going to do is to extend the CPU bus outside of the computer and add
   four more wires to go with it. This combination of 12 wires will be called the I/O Bus.
   Everything that is connected to the computer is attached to this one I/O bus.

2. The devices that are connected to the I/O bus are called 'peripherals,' because they are not
   inside the computer, they are outside of the computer, on its periphery(the area around it.)
