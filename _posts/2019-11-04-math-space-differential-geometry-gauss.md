#### quadratic form and homogeneous polynomials
1. In mathematics, a quadratic form is a polynomial with terms all of degree
   two, for example,
$$
4x^2 + 2xy - 3y^2
$$
is a quadratic form in the variables x and y. The coefficients usually belongs
to a fixed field K.
2. homogeneous polynomials, a homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial whose
   nonzero terms all have the same degree.
$$
x^5+2x^3y^2+9xy
$$
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.
3. A quadratic form is one case of the more general concept of homogeneous
   polynomials.


#### H
Gauss introduced the idea of describing a surface S parametrically.

#### Question
we can seperate points on a surface into elliptic points, hyperbolic points and
parabolic points.
