#### Background
1. The Euclidean space $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ is the prototype of all manifolds. Not
   only is it the simplest, but locally every manifold looks like$ \mathbb{R}^{n} $.
2. A good understanding of $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ is essential in generalizing
   differential and integral calculus to a manifold.


#### Drawback and Benefits
Euclidean space is special in having a set of standard global coordinates
1. Blessing: all construction on  $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ can be defined in terms of
   the standard coordinates and all computations carried out explicitly
2. Handicap: defined in terms of coordinates, it is often not obvious which
   concepts are intrinsic, i.e., independent of coordinates
3. Since a manifold in general does not have standard coordinates, only
   coordinate-independent concepts will make sense on a manifold.
