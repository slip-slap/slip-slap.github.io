### Represenation

#### Array Representaion
1. if a Node is at index $i$
2. its left child is at $2*i$
3. its left child is at $2*i+1$
4. its parent is at $i/2$


#### Linked list presentation 
1. we can based on the position relationship between parent and child, to create
   a tree.


### Tree

#### Complete Binary Tree
1. Represented by array, no blank space in the array.

#### Galois
1. Every data structure can be representation by two methods, array or linked
   list.
