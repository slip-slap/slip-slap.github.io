#### 
1. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation are "hard-core" programming. When you
   can write programs that grab blocks of memory on the fly, link them into
   useful strucures, and clean everything at the end so there is no residue,
   you're not just someone who can do a little coding, you're a programmer.
