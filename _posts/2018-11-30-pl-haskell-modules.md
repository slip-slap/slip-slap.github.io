#### Background
1. A haskell module is a collection of related functions,types and typeclasses
2. The Haskell standard library is split into modules, each of them contains
   functions and types that are somehow related and serve some common purpose.
- There's module for manipulating lists
- A module for concurrent programming
- A module for dealing with complex numbers
3. $\textbf{Prelude}$ module, which is imported by default.
