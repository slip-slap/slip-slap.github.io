#### notation
1. N - natural numbers
2. Z - integer   Z was used to denote integers because a germany mathmatician  did a great job on ring theory. In germany language, integers are Zahlen.
2. Q - rational numbers (from quotient)
3. R - real numbers
4. C - complex numbers

At first, there is only positive number and zero in the world, because they make sense. Natural numbes are closed 
and operations of addition and multiplification. <br />
After minus operation was created, Natural numbers  is not closed any more. So negative numbers were invented.
Numbers are extend from natural numbers to integer<br />
After divide operation was created, Integer is not closed any more. So rational numbers were invented.
Numbers are extend from integer to rational numbers. <br />
Because the first math crisis,  $$ \sqrt{2} $$ comes out, in order to deal with these numbers. So irrational numbers were invented.
Numbers are extend from ration numbers to real numbers. <br />
At last, we run into complex numbers, so what does $$2^i$$ mean, how to calulate this crap ? <br />
we can use Taylor expansion to calculate. <br /> 
complex numbers is very useful to calculate integral problem.


#### imaginary number geometry meaning
1. **i** is not a number, which means rotation 90 degree.
2. **1+i** stands for the rotate state
3. The complex numbers allow us to consider scalings and rotations as two instances of the same thing;
and by ensuring that negative reals have square roots, we get something every ploynominal equation can be 
solved: **complex number is the algebraic closure of R**

#### History
$$
y^{3}=p y+q
$$ <br />
solution: <br />
$$
y^{3}=\sqrt{\frac{q}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^{3}}}+
\sqrt[3]{\frac{q}{2}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{p}{3}\right)^{3}}}
$$

Example: <br />
$$
x^3=15x+4
$$
solution: <br />
$$
x=\sqrt[3]{2+11 \sqrt{-1}}+\sqrt[3]{2-11 \sqrt{-1}}
$$ 

$$
\begin{array}{l}{(2+i)^{3}=2+11 i} \\ {(2-i)^{3}=2-11 i}\end{array}
$$
<br />
$$
x=2+i+2-i=4
$$
