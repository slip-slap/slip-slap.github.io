#### Question 1: what is a linear map ?
A linear map is from a **vector space** to another **vector space**


#### Question 2: How to define a point p on a manifold ?
define $$(M,O,\mathscr{A})$$ is a smooth manifold <br />
curve $$\gamma: R \rightarrow M$$ is at least $$C^{1}$$ <br />
suppose $$\gamma(\lambda_{o})=p$$


#### Question 3:  what is the velocity of a curve $$\alpha$$ at point p ?
Based on question 2, we define a point on a manifold, and now we can define the velocity.
The velocity of curve $$\alpha$$ at point p is the linear map. <br />
$$V_{r,p}: C^{\infty}(M) \rightarrow R$$ <br />
Where V stands for velocity, r stands for curve, p stands for a point on curve.
$$C^{\infty}$$ stands for continuous, M stands for deferential manifold. <br />
$$C^{\infty}(M)$$: stand for a vector space: $${f: M \rightarrow R| f means smooth function}$$, equipped with the following structure <br /> 
$$(f\bigoplus g)_{p}$$:= f(p)+g(p) <br /> 
$$(\lambda\bigodot g)_{p}:= \lambda \cdot g(p)$$ <br /> 
R is also a vector space, it's pretty simple.

#### remark
The intuition which is very helpful, this is actually children uncorrupted by high school physics capture
the concept of velocity.Because it as the following: <br />
you run around the world as a child, and you observe the world around you, say the world around you, there are
some temperature function,


##### Tangent Vector Space
Def: For each point $$p \in M$$, we define the set <br /> 
$$T_{p}M :={v_{r,p}| r smooth curve}$$ <br />
which means tangent sapce to M at point P. <br />
#### observation
$$T_{p}M$$ can be made into a vector space

#### Component of a Vector respect to a chart


#### Remark 1:
Since a partial derivative is simply a directional derivation along a cooridnate axis.


#### Remark 2:
I have learn Riemann geometry for about one week. Something suddenly come to  mind, mathematician is the most clever guy in the world.
1. First, so called operation, such as addition, multiplification has to depend on space, It's just a map from a space to another space.
2. Second, Even the operation itself, it is also a space
3. 数学家对运算有着极其深刻的理解， 所谓的运算，不过是一个集合到另一个集合的映射。所以，可以运算的操作的基础就是集合的定义。
