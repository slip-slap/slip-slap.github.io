#### 1. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems(NIPS)
1. Editor Michael Jordan, Yann Lecun
2. Paper: ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks


It is by far the biggest conference in the area of AI and machine learning,
which more focused on theory and methodology.

#### 2. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition(CPVR)

1. paper: Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks
- author: Li F.-F.


#### 3. International Conference on Machine Learning(ICML)
1. Rectified linear units improve restricted boltzmann machines
- author: Hinton G.E.

#### 4. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence(AAAI)
AAAI is less theoretical than NIPS, which more focuses on application of AI.
