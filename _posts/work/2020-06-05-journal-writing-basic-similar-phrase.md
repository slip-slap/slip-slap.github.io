#### for example and for instance
There is very little difference between *for example* and *for instance*. They
have the same or nearly the same meaning, and they are used in the same way.
- However, that *for example* is used much more frequently than *for instance*,
  particularly in formal contexts, so in academic writing it is a safer choice.


##### Example
1. Poor balance is a problem for a lot of older people, like my grandmother,
   for instance.
2. Mobile devices are becoming less expensive. Sophisticated smartphones, for
   instance, can now be purchased for less than \$100.
