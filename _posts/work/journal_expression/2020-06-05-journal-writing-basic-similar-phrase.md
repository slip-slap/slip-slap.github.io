#### for example and for instance
There is very little difference between *for example* and *for instance*. They
have the same or nearly the same meaning, and they are used in the same way.
- However, that *for example* is used much more frequently than *for instance*,
  particularly in formal contexts, so in academic writing it is a safer choice.


##### Example
1. Poor balance is a problem for a lot of older people, like my grandmother,
   for instance.
2. Mobile devices are becoming less expensive. Sophisticated smartphones, for
   instance, can now be purchased for less than \$100.


#### various and diverse
1. various: many options
2. diverse: many different options


#### can and be able to
1. The verbs succeed, manage are alternative for the verb can.

#### via and through
1. The word via means "travelling to a sepcified destination using a route that
   passes through the following location."
- We drove to home via a suspermarket.
2. The word through means “moving into one side of, and then out of the other
   side of, a location”
- You can get the money if you reach through the gap in the wall.
