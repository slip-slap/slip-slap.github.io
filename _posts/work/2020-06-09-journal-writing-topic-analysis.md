Let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbf{R}$, and let $x_0 \in X$ be an element of X
which is also a limit point of X. Let $$ f: X \rightarrow \mathbf{R} $$ be a
function. If the limit
$$
\lim _{x \rightarrow x_{0} ; x \in X-\left\{x_{0}\right\}} \frac{f(x)-f\left(x_{0}\right)}{x-x_{0}}
$$
converges to some real number $L$, then we say that $f$ is $differentiable at x_0 with derivative L$.
