#### Definition
Conjunction are linking words like and, or, but, then and because.

#### Basic rule
Conjunction allows(but not compel) the omission of all kinds of words after them.



#### Because, as or since?

##### Because
Because is more common than as and since, both in writing and speaking. When we
use because, we are focusing on the reason:
- She spoke quietly because she didn't want Catherine to hear.

We often put the because-clause at the beginning of a sentence, especially when
we want to give extra focus to the reason.

##### As and since
We often use as and since when we want to focus more on the result than the reason.
We usually put a comma before since after the main clause.

- They are rather expensive, since they're quite hard to find.
