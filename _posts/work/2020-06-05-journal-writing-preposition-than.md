####
1. Local optimization methods are more art than technology.
2. This idea can be generalized to more than two points.
3. In addition, there are more tricks for transforming convex problems than for transforming linear problems.

#### Subject
1. The theory of convex optimization is far more straighforward than the theory
   of general nonlinear optimization.
2. Using a local optimization method is more tricker than solving a
   least-square problem, linear program, or convex optimization problem.
3. It has been recognized that the theory of convex optimization is far more
   straightforward than the theory of general nonlinear optimization.


#### Galois
1. think of "than" as the other prepositions, i.e., of, than, to for.
