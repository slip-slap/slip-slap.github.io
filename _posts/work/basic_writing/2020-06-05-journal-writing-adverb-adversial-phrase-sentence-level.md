#### Motivation
Use adverbs and commas to fine-tune your sentences, to produce highly specific meanings at the sentence level.
Explore multiple ways to convey your meaning, even to moving words around in your sentences.

#### 1.
We don't use comma to separate single-word adverb from the word they modify.

#### Adverb location
Some of the fun in playing with adverbs is moving them around a sentence.
While adverbs that modify adjectives and other adverbs must come immediately
before the adjective or adverb, there are options when an adverb modifies a
verb. We can put the adverb near the verb, but we don't have to. All of the following cases work.
- Quickly she raced to the hospital.
- She quickly raced to the hospital.
- She raced quickly to the hosptial.
- She raced to the hospital quickly.

#### Sentence verb
Sentence adverbs are different from typical adverbs. They reflect the attitude,
opinion, or judgement of the speaker. This is the writer, speaker, or thinker
revealing himself through a word choice.

1. Sadly, Cinderella didn't make it to the ball that year.
2. Frankly, I didn't think he could do it.

These adverbs aren't modifying the verb or another modifier; they applt to the
sentence as a whole.

1. Sentence adverbs can go at the end of a sentence or clause rather than at
   the beginning. In the end position, they may come across as an afterthough or parenthetical.
2. This use at the end of a clause may create a more informal feel to the sentence.
- I didn't think he could do it, frankly.

#### Adverbial phrases
We often use a comma to separate multiword adverbial phrases or clauses from
the rest of the sentence when the phrase or clause comes first.

- Over the course of a very long night, the surgeon operated on three children.

##### Remark
The use of commas after prepositional phrases isn't always straightforward. We
use a comma after some prepositional phrases at the beginning of a sentence but
not after others.
- Use a comma after prepositional phrases of five or more words, use a comma to
  eliminate confusion.



#### Conjunctive adverbs
Conjunctive adverbs are one more type of adverb that can function as sentence adverbs.

1. A common use for them is to connect independent clauses within a sentence.
   When used for this purpose, the conjunctive adverb follows a semicolon and
   is followd by a comma.

- Dudley didn's like beans; however, he ate them in order to get his favourite dessert.

2. Conjunctive adverbs can also come at the beginning of a sentence, connecting
   not two independent clauses in one sentence.
- Pat lost the instruction. Moreover, no one knew how to operate the danged machine.
