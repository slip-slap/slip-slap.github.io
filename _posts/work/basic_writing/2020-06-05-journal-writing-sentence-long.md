For instance, the Riemann hypothesis - one of the most important unsolved
problems in mathematics - would likely remain out of reach in the near future
even if we threw huge amounts of money, computer power, and people at the
problem, because we don't have a plausible theoretical approach to the problem
yet. -- Terrace Tao
