#### claim/reason/evidence

American higher education must curb escalating tuition costs(clain), because the price
of college is becoming an impediment to realizing the American dream(reason). Today a
majority of students leave college with a crushing debt burden(evidence).

Alternative: In 2013, nearly 70 percent of students borrowed money for college
with loans averaging $30,000  

#### claim: significant and specific
Although many believe that school uniforms help lower the incidence
of violence in public schools(qualification) the evidence is at best
weak(claim) because researchers have not controlled for other measures
that have been instituted at the same time as uniforms(reason 1)
and because the data reported are statistically suspect(reason 2).

##### Significant

I describe here six thirteenth century Latin grammars of the Welsh language.
Found just recently, these grammars are the only examples of their kind. They
help us better appreciate the range of grammars written in the medieval period.
