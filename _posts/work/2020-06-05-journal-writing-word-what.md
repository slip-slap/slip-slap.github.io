#### Example
2. To see what these constraints are, we note that $a_n \gt 0$.
3. You have to decide what is the appropriate notion of locality in this case.
4. To better understand what is happening.
5. We ask under what circumstances will a Markov chain converge to the desired distribution
6. It has been difficult to know to what extent these solutions should be made
widely available.
7. We did not discuss what form those basis functions might take. 



#### Whether
1. If none of the variables are observed, then we can investigate whether $a$ and $b$ are
independent by marginalizing both sides of (8.23) with respect to $c$ to give
$$
p(a, b)=\sum_{c} p(a \mid c) p(b \mid c) p(c) \textstyle{.}
$$

2. We might ask whether it is possible to define an alternative graphical
   semantics for probability distributions such that conditional independence
   is determined by simple graph separation.
