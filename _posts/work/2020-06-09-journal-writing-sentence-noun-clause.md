#### Remark
In English grammar, noun clauses begin with a question word and contain a
subject and a verb. You can use question words who, what, when, where, shy, and
how to from a noun clause. The grammar is as the following
- question word + subject + verb


#### Example
Who she kissed is not important
- It is not important who she kissed. The fact that she kissed another guy bothers me.


#### Who, which and what
##### Difference
1. We prefer *which* when the number of choices is limited.
- We have got small and large eggs. Which will you have.
2. *what* is preferred when the number of choices is unlimited.
- What is your phone number?
- What is your name?

#### Before nouns
Before nouns, *Which* and *what* can be used to ask questions about both things and people.
- What books have you read on this subject?
- What authors do you like best?
- Which way shall we go?
