####

exploration and exploitation trade-off/delima.


computationally inexpensive in terms of both memory requirements and
speed


Genetic algorithms, first developed and investigated by John Holland, are a
family of computational models inspired by the concept of 'survial of the
fittest' and have gained significant application in search, optimization, and
machine learning.



John Henry Holland





#### Introduction
1. gradient based optimization
2. stochastic optimization
3. local minima
4. locate globally optimum configurations
5. The tuning of many parameters by trial and error
- However, there are many parameters in genetic algorithms that should be tuned.
- without explicit parameter tuning.
6. high computational intensity

####
1. selection scheme
- despite limited empirical succes in using this method or that, a general answer remains elusive.
2. crossing set
3. satisfy/meet/fullfil  the constraints
4. preventing premature convergence on poor solutions


#### representation of design variables
1. improve the efficiency


#### selection
1. mating pool



####
1. constrained problems
2. incorporating problem-specific knowledge

#### Phase
1. evaluate the objective function
2. infeasible solution
3. exploration and exploitation dilemma inherent in selection


####
Each gene in a chromosome corresponds basically a ply angle.

#### Sentence
1. The probability of selection p of an individual from the $i$th class in the $t$th generation is
   calculated as 

   $a = b$,
   where a = 3.
