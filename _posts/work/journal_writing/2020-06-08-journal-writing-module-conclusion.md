- In this work

- It was demonstrated that the representation depth is beneficial for the
classification accuracy, and the start-of-art performance on the ImageNet
challenge dataset can be achieved using a conventional ConvNet architecture.


#### Examples
Our findings underline the dependence of the optimal design of the failure criterion chosen.



#### Examples
1. This technique has also been successfully used on single-material laminates.

#### 1.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows, Section 2 explains...,
section 3 describes..., and in the Conclusion section we discuss the results.



#### 2. Conclusion
Selection is such a critical piece of the GA puzzle that better understanding at its foundation can
only help advance the state of genetic algorithm art.
