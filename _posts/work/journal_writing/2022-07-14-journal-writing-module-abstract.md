#### Why bother abstract?
It should enable the reader to deduce the purpose and the results of the
article to help him decide if it is worth reading.


#### Things shouldn't appear within it.
1. be clear and independent
- Acronyms or abbreviations.
- References to other literature.
- Citations to other works.
- Any sort of image, illustration, figure, or table.

2. be concise
- Lengthy background or contextual information.
- Redundant phrases, unnecessary adverbs and adjectives, and repetitive information.

#### Template
1. A genetic algorithm is used to obtain $\cdots$.
2. It is concluded that the repair strategy should always be used with the optimization.





#### Example 1
1. We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network
2. The simulation results clearly show that the particle swarm optimization
   algorithm provides better solutions in terms of performance and computational
   time then the genetic algorithm based approaches.

#### Example 2
1. Both benchmarks have been the focus of intense research for almost a decade,
raising the danger of overfitting to excessivele reused test sets.(source: Do
ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?)
2. Our results suggest that the accuracy drops are not cause by adaptivity, but
   by the models' inability to generalize to slightly "harder" images than those
   found in the original test sets.
