#### Template 1
The formula be written as
	$a=b+1$,
	$c=m^2$,
where 
	$a=1$,
	$b=2$.

#### Template 2
From equation (2.94), the stress in the local are given by

$a = b + c$,
$c = d + f$,

where d and f are in units of MPa.

#### Template 3
Newton's second law of motion, ma=f, is maybe one of the first differential equations written.

####
1. The negation of 3 is -3.
2. Similarly, we let X denotes this variable.


#### Percent and Percentage
1. percent is always associated with a specific number. 
2. percentage is to refer to a general relationship rather than a specific number.

We use Sk to denote the set of symmetric k × k matrices, Sk
to denote the set of symmetric positive semidefinite k × k matrices, and Sk
to denote the set of symmetric positive definite k × k matrices.
