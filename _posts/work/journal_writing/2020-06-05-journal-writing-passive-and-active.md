#### Why active voice?
In most(but not all) cases, the passive contruction is longer, clunkier, and more vague.

- The poorer people were deprived of their opportunities.
- Talks have been conducted on the subject of starting a worker program for the illegal immigrants.

In each of these examples, the passive void construction gives us unnecessary words and clunky sentences that can be easily revised.
- Harsh immigration laws deprive poorer people of opportunities.
- President Bush has proposed starting a worker program for the illegal immigrants.



#### A matter of taste
When should we use the passive voice in preference to the active?

1. We do not know who the agent is?
- I had the feeling that I was being followed.
- I had the feeling that somebody was following me.

2. When it is obvious to the listener or reader who the agent is.
- She discovered that she was being paid less than her male colleagues.

3. When it is not important to know who the agent is.
4. When the agent has already been mentioned.
- In the next session of parliament, new laws will be introduced aimed at
  stopping domestic violence.
- In the next session of parliament, the goverment will introduce new laws
  aimed at stopping domestic violence.

5. When people in general are the agents:
- All the Beatles records can be borrowed from the central library.
- You can borrow all the Beatles records from the central library.


#### Example
1. Since 1990 many applications have been found in areas such as automatic
   control systems, estimation and signal processing, communications and
   networks, electronic circuit design, data analysis and modeling, statistics,
   and finance.
2. The second one is preferred.
