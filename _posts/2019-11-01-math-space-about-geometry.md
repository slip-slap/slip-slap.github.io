#### History
1. In classical mathematics, analytic geometry, also known as coordinate
   geometry, or Cartesian geometry which is study geometry using a coordinate
   system.

#### Geometry
There are so many geometrys, Euclidean Geometry, Projective Geometry,
Differential Geometry, Hyperbolic Geometry, Spherical Geometry, Affine Geometry.
But the question is how to study them ?
1. Study the properties of the geometry.
2. Associate this geometry with a coordinate system, maybe vector space, I think
   vector space is better option, because It doesn't change depend on the
   choosen coordinate system.
#### Example: Cartesian Geometry
1. Euclidean Geometry study the properties of geometry itself, for example,
parallel, angle, distance et. 
2. Second, put this geometry in two-dimensional coordiate system to study the
   geometry.

#### word
1. synthetic geometry: sometimes refered to pure geometry, is the study of 
geometry without the use of coordinates. It relies on the axiomatic method and
the tools directly related to them, that is compass and straightedge, to draw
conclusions and solve problems.
2. only after the introduction of coordinates there is a reason to introduce
the term "synthetic geometry" to distinguish this approach to geometry from 
other approaches.

#### Galois review 
1. After learn Euclidean Geometry, I begin to take everything
for granted. Angle, distance, parallel, all of these things kind of like Bibles.
Actually, maybe the Euclidean Geometry is just a small part of all the
geometry that we know about the world, what if we don't have the metric
concept of distance, what if we don't have metric concept of angle, and only
the concept of parallel, if we abandon angle and distance, just parallel,
point and line, can this form geometry !!!!
2. From the begining, I learn geometry by coordinate and formula, but actually,
before coordinates come out, mathematican prefer to use synthetic geometry to
solve problems.
