#### Introduction
In many applications of probability theory, we will be faced with the following
problem. Suppose that $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$ is an identically and independently
distributed sequence, $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$ is a $sample$ from some distribution,
and we are interested in the distribution of a new random variable $Y=h(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n)$
for some function h. In particular, we might want to compute the distribution
function of Y or perhaps its mean and variance. The distribution of Y is
sometimes referred to as its **sampling distribution**, as Y is based on a sample
from some underlying distribution.
