#### BFS
1. BFS stands for Breadth First Search is a vertex based techinique for finding
   a shortest path in graph. 
- It uses a Queue data structure which follows first in first out. In BFS, one
  vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent
  are visited and stored in the queue. 




#### Application
1. web crawling
2. social networking
3. network broadcast
4. garbage collection
5. model checking
6. mathematical conjecture checking
7. solving puzzles games
