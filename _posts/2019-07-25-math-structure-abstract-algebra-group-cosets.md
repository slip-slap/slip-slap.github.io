#### Definition
Let G be a group and H a subgroup of G. Define a $\textbf{left coset}$ of H with
representative  $g \in G$ to be the set
$
g H=\{g h: h \in H\}
$

$\textbf{Right cosets}$ can defined similarly by
$
H g=\{h g: h \in H\}
$

- If left and right cosets coincide or if it is clear from the context to which
  type of coset that we are referring, we will use the word coset without
  specifying left or right.


#### Lagrange's Theorem
Let H be a subgroup of G with $g \in G and define a map $\phi: H \rightarrow gH$ 
by $\phi (h) = gh$. The map $\phi$ is bijective; hence, the number of elements
in H is the same as the number of elements in gH.
