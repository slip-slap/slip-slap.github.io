#### Background
1. Most construction in category theory are generalizations of results from
   other more specific areas of mathematics. Things like products, coproducts,
   monoids, exponentials, have been known long before category theory.
- A Cartesian product in set theory
- A meet in order theory
- A conjuction in logic
- They are all specific examples of the abstract idea of categorical product.
