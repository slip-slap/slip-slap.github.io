####  Dual and Perpendicularity

##### Dual
1. The point 
$
a \equiv[x: y: z]
$
is dual to the line $a^{\perp} \equiv (x:y:z)$
2. The line $L \equiv(l:m:n)$ is dual to the point $L^{\perp} \equiv [l:m:n]$

##### Perpendicularity
1. Point Perpendicular: The points a and b are perpendicular, if a lies on $
b^{\perp} $ denotes as $a \perp b$ <br />
Two points can be perpendicular, **amazing**
2. Line Perpendicular: The lines L and M are perpendicular $\leftrightarrow$ L
   passes through $M^{\perp}$ $\leftrightarrow$ M passes through
   $L^{\perp}$,denote as $L \perp M$

#### Galios
1. the method of research is always the same. First we introduce the concept of
   hyperbolic geometry.
2. In the following, we try to use algebra to solve these problems, which we
   introduce coordinate, maybe calculus.
3. For example, In topology algebra, also introduce algebra to solve relavent
   problems.
