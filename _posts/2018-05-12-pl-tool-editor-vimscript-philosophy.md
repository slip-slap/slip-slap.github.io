#### Always Stay on Normal Mode
The phiosophy of this is that vim commands are meant to be combined, and this
makes a lot more sense once you begin grokking vim, and stop seeing files as
something you edit, but instead as grid-like blocks of text that you can freely
manipulate and command

##### Normal Command is Language
1. verbs: **c**(change), **d**(delete), **y**(yank) 
2. nouns: **w**(word) , **}**(paragraph), **G**(eof) 
3. adjective: numberical prefixes and your descriptors.
