#### 1.  .a extension and .dylib extension
1. .a extension means a static library.
- Static libraries allow application to load code into its address space at compile time.
- This results in a larger size in disk and slower launch times.

2. .dylib extension means dynamic library
- Dynamic libraries allow an application to load code into its address space at runtime.
