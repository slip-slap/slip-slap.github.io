#### I
If the part of a sentence qualified by "今度" describes the past or present. "今度" means this time.
and if the part is about the future, "今度" will be next time.
Ultimately there is no choice but to judge in the context not by "今度" itself.
- 今度はフラインスへ行きたい(next time I want to go to france)
- 今度の事件は難しいなあ(this time is very difficult)


#### 先
先 can mean prior and posterior at the same time, it depends
1. with これから、先 expresses the posterior time
2. この and これから are swapable
- この先、雨が降るだろう
- これから先、彼は立派な大人になるに間違いない
3. prior


#### 3. そりゃあまあ
1. そりゃあ: means "that's", it is often used at the beggining of a sentence, like an interjection, to
   indicate the speaker is trying to give some explanation
2. まあ: is like "you know" or "well", used before unimportant or something that the listener may
   already understand.
3. ねえ: is like "... isn't it?" or "you know", used to show a positive response is expected.

-  あの人のことが嫌いなの？どうして
- そりゃあまあ、ねえ(B doesn't want to state the reason explicitly, but is expecting A would guess
  it)
