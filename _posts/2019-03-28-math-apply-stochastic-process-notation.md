#### set theory
1. Sample space: there elements in that sample space  
2. events:   events are subsets of the sample space.
3. sample space: a set in which all of the possible outcomes of a statistical experiment are represented as points --from Merriam Webster
4. according to the axioms, there are only sample space, events, and probability.
So a random variable, it's a function from the set of sample points to the set of real values.
