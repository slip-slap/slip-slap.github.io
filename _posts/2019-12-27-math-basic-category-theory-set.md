#### Background
1. Mathematicians have a love/hate relationship with set theory. It's the
   assembly language of mathematics - at least it used to be.
- Category theory tries to step away from set theory, to some extent.
- For instance, the set of all sets doesn't exist, but the category of all sets,
  $\textbf{Set}$, does.
- On the other hand, we assume that morphisms between any two objects in a
  category form a set. We even called it a hom-set.

2. There is a branch of category theory where morphisms don't form sets. Instead
   they are objects in another category. Those categories that use hom-objects
   rather than hom-sets, are called enriched categories.


#### Motivation
A set is the closest thing to a featureless blob you can get outside of
categorical objects
