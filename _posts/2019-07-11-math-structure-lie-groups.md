#### Definition
A Lie group is, roughly speaking, a continuous group, that is, a group described
by several real parameters. In this book, we consider matrix Lie groups, which
are Lie groups realized as groups of matrices
- Consider the set of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices with determinant 1, denoted
$ \mathrm{SL}(2 ; \mathbb{R}) $

#### A
1. General Linear Group over the real numbers, denoted 
$ \mathrm{GL}(n ; \mathbb{R}) $, is the group of all $n \times n$ invertible
matrices with real entries. The general linear group over the complex numbers,
denoted 
$ \mathrm{GL}(2 ; \mathbb{C}) $, is the group of all $n \times n$ invertible
matrices with complex entries.

2. Let $ M_{n}(\mathbb{C}) $ denote the space of all $n \times n$ matrices with
   complex entries




#### Inspiration
Lie's original motivation was to study the group of transformations of a space
as a continuous analogue of the group of permutations of a finite set.
- Indeed, a diffeomorphism of a manifold M can be viewed as a permutation of the
  points of M.
- The Interplay of group theory of group theory, topology, and linear algebra
  makes the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras a particularly rich and
  vibrant branch of mathematics.


#### Application
In manifold theory, Lie groups serve mainly as an important class of manifolds,
and Lie algebras as examples of tangent spaces.
