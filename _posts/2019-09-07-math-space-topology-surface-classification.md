#### What is surface?
A surface is a topological space $S$ such that every point $s \in S$ has a
neighborhood homeomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^2$


####  Compact Surface
1. A compact surface is a surface which is also a compact set. A compact surface
has a triangulation with a finite number of triangles. The sphere and torus are
compact.
2. compact means boundary and closed which doesn't has any hole.


#### HAHA
With edges labelled by letters and directed, and every edge occurs exactly
twice.
