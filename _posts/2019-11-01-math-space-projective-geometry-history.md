1. Pappus:

2. Desargues: Desargues's theorem

3. Pascal:

4. Mobius:
5. Plucker:
6. Klein: new understanding

#### Galois
All of a sudden, you realize the connection among Pappus, Desargues and Pascal's
work. It's a very natural phenomean, you need time to understand things, take
your time, be patient!


#### Concept
1. projective  plane: a   projective plane  is a geometric structure that
   extends the concept of a plane, In the   ordinary  Euclidean plane, two lines
   typically intersect in a single point, but there are some pairs of
   lines(namely, parallel lines) that do not intersect. A projective plane can
   be though of as an ordinary plane equipped with additional "points" at
   infinity where parallel lines intersect. Thus any two distict lines in a
   projective plane intersect in one and only one point.

2. projection plane or plane of projection:


#### Concept

#### principal
1. Sets of parallel lines meet at a vanishing point.


#### axioms: Duality
1. The axioms for a projective plane had a symmetry with respect points and
   lines. In fact, the word "points" and the word "line" can be interchanged and
   the axioms remain the same. Any statement in projective geometry can reverse
   the words "line" and "point" and it should make sense.
2. In geometry, a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the
   roles played by points and lines in the definitions and theorems, and plane
   duality is the formalization of this concept.



#### Problems with Euclidean Geometry
What if point goes far away to infinity? The point at infinity would becomes
meaningless in Euclidean Geometry. The parallel lines should meet at infinity in
projective space, but can not do in Euclidean space.





#### Euclidean Geometry and Projective Geometry
1. Euclidean geometry describes shapes "as they are"
2. Projective geometry describes objects "as they appear"
3. Lengths, angles, parallelism become "distorted" when we look at objects
4. Mathematical model for how images of the 3D world.

#### remark
1. In Eulidean space, two paraell lines can not meet each other forever, It is a
   common sense that everyone is familiar with.
2. However, it is not true any more in projective geometry, for example, the
   train railroad becomes narrowerer while it moves far away from eyes. Finally,
   the two parallel rails meet at the horizon, which is a point at infinity.
3. Euclidean geometry is a subset of projective geometry.

#### Terminology 
It is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with
respect to projective transformations.

#### Terminology
1. projective line: space of 1-dim subspaces in 2-dim space.
2. projective plane: 1-dim subspaces in 3-dim space.

#### application
1. draw tiles from three-dimensional on two-dimensional plane, we must need
   projectile geometry.

#### remark
1. projective geometry is an elementary non-metrical form of geometry, meaning
   that it is not based on a concept of distance.
2. Projective geometry can also be seen as a geometry of constructions with a
   straight-edge alone.  Since projective geometry excludes compass
   constructions, there are no circle, no angles, no measuremetns, no parallels.

#### Galois
1. Projective **real, real, real** exists which is not created by imagination,
According to Pappus, Desargues and Pascal't theory, the intersection of three
line must be colliner, if two lines are parallel, then the intersection must in
infinity.
2. Finally, I **accept projective geometry**, It really really exists.

#### word 
1: perspective: is the art and mathematics of realistically depicting
three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane, sometimes called centric
or natural perspective. The study of projection of objects in a plane is called
projective geometry.  2: quadric: used where there are more than two variables
