#### Definition
1. Scalar Field: If to each point $(x,y,z)$ of a region R in space there corresponds a number
   or scalar $ \phi(x, y, z) $, then $\phi$ is called scalar function of
   position or scalar point function and we say that a scalar filed $\phi$ has
   been defined in R.
- A scalar field which is independent of time is called a stationary or
  steady-state scalar field
2. Vector Field: If to each point $(x,y,z)$ of a region R in space there
   Vcorresponds a vector $ \mathbf{V}(x, y, z) $, then $\mathbf{V}$ is called a
   vector function of position or vector point function and we say that a vector
   field $\mathbf{V}$ has been defined in R.
