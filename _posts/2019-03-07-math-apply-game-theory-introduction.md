#### reminder
1. put yourself in ohter's shoes and try to figure out what they would do
2. don't play a dominated strategy
3. Yale students are evil
4. Rational choices can lead to bad choices
5. you can't get what you want until you know what you want



#### prisoner's dilemma
two members of a gang of bank robbers. Dave and Henry, have been arrested and are being interrogated in separate rooms.
The authorities have no other witness, and can only prove the case against them if they can convince at least one of the
robbers to betray his accomplice and testify to the crime. <br />
Each bank robber is faced with the choice to cooperate with his accomplice and remain silent or to defect from the gang and
testify for the prosecution. <br />
1. if they both co-operate and remain silent, then the authorites will only be able to convict them on a lesser charge of loitering,
which will mean one year in jail each.
2. if one testifites and the other does not, then the one who testifies will go free and the ohter will get three years.
3. if both testify against the other, each will get two years in jail for being partly responsible for the robbery, 2 years for both of them.

#### problem
1. without showing your neighbor what you are doing, put it in the box below a whole number between 1 and 100, we will calculated the average number
chosen in the class and the winner of this game is the person who gets closet to two-thirds times the average number. They will win five dollars.
