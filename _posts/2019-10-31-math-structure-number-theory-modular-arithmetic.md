#### definition
modular arithmetic: modular arithmetic can be handled mathematically by introducing a congruence relation
on the integers that is compatible with the operations on integers: addition, subtraction, and muliplication


#### Polynomial arithmetic in Field (prime=11)
Example:
$$
q=\alpha^{k}
$$
and, <br />
$$
q(\alpha + \beta) = (\alpha + \beta)^{k}
$$

if k=p <br />
$$
q(\alpha) = \beta^{p}+(\alpha - \beta)^p
$$

and 

#### primitive root


#### word
1. arithmetic: a branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and their addition, subtraction, multiplication
, andi division.
