#### Notation
1. $$
\boldsymbol{x}=\left[\begin{array}{llll}{x_{1}} & {x_{2}} & {\dots} &
{x_{m}}\end{array}\right]^{\mathrm{T}}
$$: to simplify writing column vectors in-line with other text, sometimes they
are written as row vectors with the transpose operation applied to them.


<br />
#### Spanning Sets
A set of vector $$
\left\{\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \dots, \vec{v}_{n}\right\}
$$ is a spanning set for <br />
$\mathcal{A^3} \leftrightarrow$ for every vector $\vec{v} \in \mathcal{A^3}$ 
can be written as: <br />
$$
\vec{v}=a_{1} \vec{v}_{1}+a_{2} \vec{v}_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} \vec{v}_{n}
$$


<br />
#### Linear Independent Sets
a set of vectors 
$$
\left\{\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \dots, \vec{v}_{n}\right\}
$$
in $\mathcal{A^3}$ is linearly independent
$\leftrightarrow$ none of the vectors can be written as linear combination of
the others.



<br />
##### Example
$$
\begin{array}{l}{\left\{\left(\begin{array}{c}{2} \\ {3} \\
{-1}\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{c}{4} \\ {2} \\
{1}\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{c}{-2} \\ {5} \\
{-5}\end{array}\right)\right\}} \\ {\left(\begin{array}{c}{-2} \\ {5} \\
{-5}\end{array}\right)=3\left(\begin{array}{c}{2} \\ {3} \\
{-1}\end{array}\right)-2\left(\begin{array}{c}{4} \\ {2} \\
{1}\end{array}\right)}\end{array}
$$

Geometrically it means these three vectors span a plane in $\mathcal{A^3}$


#### Galois
1. The origin of linear algebra is affine geometry. Because of affine geometry,
   we found linear algebra. After that, linear algebra is be treated as a
   independent branch.
2. Linear algebra is just a tool for computation, **It can used to deal with so
   many problems, just as a tool to calculation, don't be afraid**.
3. We are so familiar with the computation of addition, minus,
   multiplication,division, but not too familiar with calculus, derivative,
   least familiar with matrix compuation. **As a mathematican, we shoud not
   afraid any calculation of math **
