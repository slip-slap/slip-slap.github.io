#### Concept
In algebraic topology, the Euler characteristic or Euler number is a topological
invariant, a number that describes a topological space's shape or structure
regardless of the way it is bent. It is commonly denoted by $$\chi$$

#### HAHA
You can make a model, doesn't mean it is a mathematic object.
Euler's formual holds for any polyhedron which has the topology of the sphere.
