#### Motivation
1. group composition is just set permutation.  



#### Definition
1. Transpostions: the simplest permutation is a cycle of length 2, such cycles
   are called transpositions.


#### Theorem
If a permutation $\sigma$ can be expressed as the product of an even number of
transpositions, then any other product of transpositions equaling $\sigma$ must
also contain an even number of transpositions, then any other product of
transpotitions equaling $\sigma$ must also contain an odd number of
transpositions.


#### Representation
How to represent a set permutation? it's not eazy.
