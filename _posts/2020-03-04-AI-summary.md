####  Definition
1. What does a researcher do?
- We build models, explain the past, predict the future.
2. What does AI do?
- We build models of thinking
- Algorithm enabled By constraints exposed by representation that models
  targeted at thinking, perception and action


####
1. simple: maybe powerful, simple ideas are often most powerful.
2. trivial: less powerful

#### AI, ML and DL
1. AI: first coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, **AI involues machings that can
perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence.**, while this is
rather general, it includes things like planning, understanding language,
recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem-solving.

2. ML: First coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, defining it as, "the ability to learn
without using being explicitly programmed." 
Machine Learning is simply a way of achieving AI.
- the term "explicitly programmed", how to understand, for example, in tradional
  image recognition, if you want to identify an apple, the first step is check
  the shape of the target, maybe you need create a convex hull surround the
  target, and based on the convex hull, you decided it's an apple or not.
- But with machine learning, you don't need to do like that, you just let the
  computer to find the pattern.

3. DL
DL: Deep learning is one of many approaches to machine learning. other
approaches include decision tree learning, clustering, reinforcement learning,
and Bayesian networks.
