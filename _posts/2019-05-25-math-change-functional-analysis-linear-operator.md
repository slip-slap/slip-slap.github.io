#### what is linear operator

1. Linear functional: if V is a normed space over F and T:V-F is a linear operator, then we call T a linear functional on V.
2. A mapping A: $$ U \rightarrow V $$ is linear if
$$
A(\alpha \mathbf{x}+\beta \mathbf{y})=\alpha A \mathbf{x}+\beta A \mathbf{y}
$$


#### Topology
In topology, an open map is a function between two topological spaces which maps open sets to open sets.
