#### Geometry
1. one of the key aspects in geometry is invariance. This can be somewhat
   difficult to define, but the idea is that the properties or measurements
   under discussiong should be described in such a way that they make sense
   without reference to a special system.
2. This idea has been a guiding principle since the ancient Greeks started
   formulating geometry. We'll often take for granted that work in a Euclidean
   space where we know how to compute distances, angles, areas, and even volumes
   of simple geometric figures.
3. Descartes discovered that these types of geometries could be described by
   what we call Cartesian space through coordinatizing the Euclidean space with
   Cartesian coordinates.
4. This is the general approach we shall use, but it is still worthwhile to
   occasionally try to understand meausurements not just algebraically or
   analytically, but also purely descriptively in geometric terms.
5. For example, how does one define a circle? It can defined as a set of points
   given by a specific type of equation ? It can be given as a parametric curve,
   or it can be described as the collection of points at a fixed distance from
   the center.
6. Using the latter definition withouts referring to coordinates is oftern a
   very usefull tool in solving many problems.



#### Geometry Outline
Euclidean Geometry(E.G.), Projective Geometry(P.G.), Differential
Geometry(D.G.), Hyperbolic Geometry(H.G.), Spherical Geometry(S.G.), Affine
Geometry(A.G.). Analytic Geometry, Riemann Geometry(R.G) 

But the question is how to study them ?
1. Study the properties of the geometry.
2. Associate this geometry with a coordinate system, maybe vector space, I think
   vector space is better option, because It doesn't change depend on the
   choosen coordinate system.

#### History
1. Gauss is the first guy who finds Non-Euclidean Geometry, but he keep this to himself, never told
anybody. you may say he is perfectism, but maybe he just selfish. Later on, another Russian guy 
find Non-Euclidean geometry, to study his paper, Gauss learn Russian language.
2. Bolyai find Non-euclidean geometry, and pushished it. and send the paper to Gauss, but gauss 
ignore said I had alread find this. So his work is ignored by contempory scitentist.


#### Relationship Between Geometry and Algebra
1. Geometry is the most imporant thing want to deal with, like a square, a cubic,
so cartesian coordiates is developed to deal with this geometry algebraicly.
2. Differential Geometry is dealed with in an differential way, vector,
   integration, differential, are used.
3. Affine Geometry, linear algebra is developed.
4. Now we want to unify all these geometry in one framework. Tensor is
   coming.






#### Example: Cartesian Geometry
1. Euclidean Geometry study the properties of geometry itself, for example,
parallel, angle, distance et. 
2. Second, put this geometry in two-dimensional coordiate system to study the
   geometry.

#### word
1. synthetic geometry: sometimes refered to pure geometry, is the study of 
geometry without the use of coordinates. It relies on the axiomatic method and
the tools directly related to them, that is compass and straightedge, to draw
conclusions and solve problems.
2. only after the introduction of coordinates there is a reason to introduce
the term "synthetic geometry" to distinguish this approach to geometry from 
other approaches.

#### Galois review 
1. After learn Euclidean Geometry, I begin to take everything
for granted. Angle, distance, parallel, all of these things kind of like Bibles.
Actually, maybe the Euclidean Geometry is just a small part of all the
geometry that we know about the world, what if we don't have the metric
concept of distance, what if we don't have metric concept of angle, and only
the concept of parallel, if we abandon angle and distance, just parallel,
point and line, can this form geometry !!!!
2. From the begining, I learn geometry by coordinate and formula, but actually,
before coordinates come out, mathematican prefer to use synthetic geometry to
solve problems.
