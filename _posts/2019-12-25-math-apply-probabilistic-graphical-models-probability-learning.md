#### Motivation
1. In some domains, the amount of knowledge required is just too large or the
   expert's time is too valuable. In others, there are simply no experts who
   have sufficient understanding of the domain. In many domains, the properties
   of the distribution change from one application site to another or over time,
   and we cannot expect an expert to sit and redesign the network every few
   weeks.
